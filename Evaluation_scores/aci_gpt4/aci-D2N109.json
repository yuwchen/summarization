    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Stephanie Morales is a 36-year-old female who presents with left ankle pain after slipping on ice two days ago. She reports twisting her ankle on the outside and falling down. She has been taking ibuprofen, ice, and elevation for pain and swelling, with minimal relief. She denies any pain above her ankle, bleeding, or other injuries. She has a history of diabetes and hypertension, which are well controlled with metformin and norvasc. She is due for an eye exam for her diabetes in the next couple of weeks.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n Vital signs are stable. Neck exam is normal, no bruits. Lungs are clear. Heart exam reveals a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, unchanged from previous. Abdomen is soft and nontender. Left ankle exam shows tenderness over the lateral malleolus and the fifth metatarsal, swelling, redness, and pain with valgus stress. Sensation and pulses are intact.  \nRESULTS\n Ankle x-ray is ordered to rule out fracture. Hemoglobin A1c and other baseline labs are ordered for diabetes and hypertension management.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The most likely diagnosis is ankle sprain, but fracture cannot be excluded. The patient is placed in an air splint and given crutches, and advised to avoid weightbearing until x-ray results are available. She is prescribed naprosyn 500 mg twice a day for pain control, and instructed to continue ice and elevation. She will be contacted if the x-ray shows a fracture and referred to orthopedics. Otherwise, she will be advised to remove the air splint and do partial weightbearing as tolerated. She is encouraged to keep her eye appointment for diabetes, and to continue with her metformin and norvasc. She is given a refill for norvasc and a follow-up appointment in four weeks. She is educated about the signs and symptoms of infection, compartment syndrome, and deep vein thrombosis, and instructed to call the office or go to the emergency department if she develops any of them.",
