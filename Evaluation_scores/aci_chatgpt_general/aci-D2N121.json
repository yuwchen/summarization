    "The patient, who recently experienced knee pain after a skiing accident on their boat, visits the doctor. The doctor asks about the details of the accident and the patient's symptoms. The patient reports no popping sensation, only a stretching feeling and subsequent swelling. They were able to get out of the water by themselves, but movement like squatting and bending is painful. This is the first time the patient injured their knee. The doctor also discusses the patient's high blood pressure and confirms they are taking their medication without any issues. The doctor asks about any foot numbness or tingling, to which the patient responds with only swelling and pain in the knee. The patient has been taking over-the-counter Aleve and using cold packs for pain relief. The doctor notes that the patient had tonsil surgery in the past and proceeds with a physical examination. The findings include good blood pressure management, no abnormalities in the neck and heart exams, clear lungs, swelling and pain in the right knee, decreased range of motion, and some inflammation. The doctor suspects a medial collateral ligament strain and plans to order an x-ray to rule out any broken bones. They will refer the patient to physical therapy for muscle strengthening. The doctor will also prescribe meloxicam for swelling and pain. The patient asks if they can still ski with the medication, but the doctor advises them to rest and avoid skiing until further evaluation. Regarding hypertension, the doctor will continue the current medication, order a lipid panel test, and administer a tetanus shot as needed. The patient agrees with the treatment plan and thanks the doctor.",
