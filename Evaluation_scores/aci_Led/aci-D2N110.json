HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Wayne Taylor is a pleasant 66-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right diabetic foot Ulcer. The onset of his neuropathy began 2 to 3 weeks ago, after he bought a new pair of shoes to travel with. He describes the wound as a blister but says it has worsened and he has been putting a band-aid on the wound. He finished the course yesterday and says the wound is about the same. He denies any fever, chills, drainage from the wound, or other symptoms. The patient states that when he takes his sock off, it sticks to the wound; however, he is still wearing the same shoes that cause the problem. He reports that he used to see a podiatrist a couple of years ago but the office moved and he was not able to get another one. His last Hgb A1c was 8.0.

I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of bone infection. I has recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal his wound. I will also perform a debridement and ointment at the office today. We discussed that we should consider obtaining a diabetic consult so that we can discuss ways to modify his diet without being too much to bring his hemoglobin a1c into a better level. He will continue to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. At this time, I do not think any more antibiotics are needed at this time.

He was seen by his primary care physician who referred him to our office. His last visit with a podiatrist was 2 years ago, however they moved, and he has been unable to get another podiatrist. He denies any specific injury.\n\nThe patient purchased a new pair of shoes and was breaking them in prior to traveling. Initially, he did not feel that the shoes were too tight, however a blister formed on his right foot. The patient does have neuropathy and notes this might be why he did not notice the tightness. His blister soon became a wound and he was seen by his PCP. He was placed on a round of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. He denies any changes to the appearance of the wound. The patient denies pain or drainage. His sock will occasionally stick to his wound, regardless of if he has a Band-Aid covering it. The patient has discontinued the use of these shoes. Occasionally, he has issues with stability, which was a primary purpose of purchasing these shoes. He denies any fever or chills.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1C was 8.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fever and chills.\nSkin: Reports right foot wound.\nNeurological: Reports neuropathy.\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature: 98.1.\nHeart rate: 72.\nRespiration: 16.\nBlood pressure: 110/65 mm Hg.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses.

At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing.
