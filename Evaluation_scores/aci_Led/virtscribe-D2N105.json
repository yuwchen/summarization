HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Diana Scott is a 100-year-old female who presents today for a new patient note. The patient was referred to me by her primary care physician. She presents today due to a murmur in her heart. This has been going on for approximately 6 months. She is not sure what symptoms she should be having; however, she feels overly tired due to taking all her medication. She also experiences shortness of breath if she walks too fast or tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. She denies any chest pain or dyspnea on exertion. Ms. Scott does report taking pain pills for her legs. She does note that she has lost a little weight, but she still weighs about 120 pounds. Her weight has been trending down for about a year. She no longer moves as fast as she used to. She endorses no fevers, chills, or passing out. The only complaint she has is severe leg pain, which she has been experiencing for about 1 month. Her legs have been severe for about 0.5 months. she denies any swelling in her ankles. She has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. However, her s2 is relatively preserved, which would be more consistent with moderate. Some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction. Her echocardiogram today shows sinus rhythm with frequent pvcs, as well as an anterior septum infarct pattern. she does not have any significant palpitations. PLAN After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her echOCardiogram will help to assess her overall cardiac structure and function, aswell as the valve view where diseased. We discussed that if her symptoms are severe, we may need to consider an ischemic evaluation or a heart mon- monitor to assess the overall burden of the Pvcs. Given her age and no history of coronary artery D- artery disease, it is possible that she might be able to stop her statin. I recommended that she continue taking amlodipine and lisinopril as they are currently. Regarding her hyperthyroidism, she can continue taking levothyroxine as they were currently. We will see her back here in 3 or 4 weeks to discuss the results and her next steps. All questions were answered. INSTRUCTIONS The patient will follow up with me in 4 weeks.", "Heart murmur.

She denies chest pain, syncope, palpitations, fevers, or chills. She reports shortness of breath if she walks too fast, too long, or tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. The patient requires a walker and can walk around her cul-de-sac or to the end of the driveway without shortness of breath. Compared to 6 months ago, her functioning has declined 20-30%. Prior to 6 months, symptoms were absent. For the past month she has been experiencing severe, bilateral leg pain, which was limiting her mobility. She did see her doctor last week who completed a chest x-ray and prescribed pain medicine. Occasionally, she feels dizzy but takes medication for this and it subsides. Her ankles have been swelling for the past 6 months, but the swelling fluctuates day to day. Her weight has been slowly decreasing over the past year, with her current weight at 120 pounds, previous weight was 130 pounds.

This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. She does have symptoms including a significant increase in fatigue over the last 6 months, shortness of breath, and some lightheadedness. This could be due to severe aortic stenosis, however, her S2 is relatively preserved which would be more consistent with moderate. She is unsure if she has had an echocardiogram, although some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction, so it is possible that she had one as some point in the past. We will order a repeat echocardiogram today to assess overall cardiac structure and function as well as valvular disease. If she does truly have severe aortic stenosis, I briefly discussed a TAVR procedure today as she is not a candidate for a surgical AVR given her age co-morbidities and frailty. She is unsure if she would be interested in this, but we will assess first with the echocardiogram and then discuss further at follow-up. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.\n\nPVCs\nHer referral mentions tachycardia. Her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations. We will check an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or possibly a heart monitor to assess the overall burden of PVCs. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only.\n\nHypertension\nShe is taking amlodipine and lisinopril. We will continue these as is.\n\nHyperlipidemia\nThis is managed by her PCP. She is on simvastatin 20 mg. She is having bilateral leg pain over the past month. This could be related to the simvastatin possibly and given her age, it would not be unreasonable to stop the simvastatin, but I will defer to her PCP. She has no known CAD but if we were to do a TAVR evaluation and this was discovered, a statin would be indicated.\n\nHypothyroidism\nShe takes levothyroxine for supplementation and will continue this as is.\n\nLightheadedness/dizziness\nShe is on meclizine for this. It is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness are related to the aortic stenosis, and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above. She is also having some PVCs on her EKG, which could be contributing, but she does not feel palpitations.
