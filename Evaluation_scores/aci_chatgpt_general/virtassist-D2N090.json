    "The doctor and patient discuss the patient's recent emergency room visit. The patient was experiencing elevated blood sugar and feeling woozy. They were not admitted to the hospital but did not monitor their diet closely, resulting in high blood sugar levels. The patient started feeling better after returning home and has since been following their diet. The doctor also discusses the patient's kidney transplant, which is currently stable, and their depression, which is being managed with meditation. The doctor recommends increasing the patient's lantus dosage for hyperglycemia and ordering another hemoglobin a1c test. They also suggest the patient continue their current strategies for managing depression and schedule a follow-up with the doctor managing their kidney transplant medications. Overall, the patient's vital signs and physical exam are normal during the visit.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nER follow-up.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAlbert Powell is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant. He is here today for an emergency room follow-up.\n\nThe patient states he was not staying on top of his blood sugar readings and felt \" woozy \" over the weekend. His wife was concerned that his levels were elevated and wanted to take him to the emergency room. He was not admitted to the hospital. He reports that his mother is in the hospital and he has been eating poorly. He was not monitoring his blood sugars and what he was eating. When they got home from the visit he felt a lot better. Since then, he has been following his diet pretty closely. He continues Lantus insulin at bedtime.\n\nRegarding his kidney transplant and has been doing pretty well. The patient has been pretty diligent about taking immunotherapy medication and following orders. The last time he saw Dr. Reyes was about 3 weeks ago and everything seemed to be fine.\n\nRegarding his depression, the patient states it has been about a year and a half, but he has been pretty good with that. He has his moments, but as long as he finds some time to relax in the afternoon and then it seems to work out. He thinks he would probably want to continue that at least for a couple more months and see how it goes. His wife got him into meditation recently and he finds that relaxing so he feels he would like to continue that for a couple more months and see how it goes.\n\nThe patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or dizziness.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.\n\u2022 Neurological: Denies lightheadedness or dizziness.\n\u2022 Psychiatric: Endorses depression.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Constitutional: in no apparent distress.\n\u2022 Neck: No carotid bruits appreciable.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: 1+ edema in the bilateral lower extremities.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFasting glucose is elevated at 162.\nHemoglobin A1c is elevated at 8.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nAlbert Powell is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant. He is here today for an emergency room follow-up.\n\nHyperglycemia.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: He was recently seen in the emergency department with elevated blood glucose levels. He admits to dietary indiscretion prior to this, but has since improved his diet. His recent blood glucose level was 162, and his recent hemoglobin A1c was 8.\n\u2022 Additional Testing: Repeat hemoglobin A1c in a few months.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: Increase Lantus to 20 units at night.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: I advised him to continue monitoring his blood glucose levels at home and report those to me, as we may need to make further adjustments to his medication.\n\nDepression.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: He reports personal stressors over the past year and a half but is doing well overall.
