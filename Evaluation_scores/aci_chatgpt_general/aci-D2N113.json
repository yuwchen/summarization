    "Summary:\nThe patient, Jacqueline, is anxious about her recent blood work which indicates that she has hepatitis C. She has never been told about this before and denies any history of IV drug use or known hepatitis C positive partners. She used to use IV drugs and drink heavily in the past but has been clean for over fifteen years. Currently, she drinks about one beer a day and smokes one to two cigarettes a day. She also mentions feeling tired at the end of the day. She has a family history of hypertension, diabetes, and depression. The doctor performs a physical exam and finds no significant abnormalities except for a 2/6 systolic murmur on heart exam. The doctor informs Jacqueline that her HCV antibody test was positive and her liver panel showed an elevated AST but other liver enzymes were within normal limits. The doctor plans to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of liver disease through additional blood work and an ultrasound. Jacqueline asks if her wife and children should be tested as well, and the doctor recommends starting with the same screening for them. The appointment ends with the nurse scheduling future appointments and Jacqueline will follow up with the doctor in three weeks.",
