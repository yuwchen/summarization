    "The patient, Andrew, is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of depression, type two diabetes, and hypertension. He presents with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection, including fatigue, shortness of breath, and possible onset of a cold. Andrew has received both doses of the COVID vaccine and has no history of seasonal allergies. His shortness of breath is primarily experienced while lifting or carrying heavy objects. He reports muscle pain in his elbows and fatigue in his knees, which he attributes to physical exertion. Andrew's other medical conditions, including depression, diabetes, and hypertension, are being managed. He monitors his blood sugar levels regularly and has noticed no significant elevations. He also checks his blood pressure regularly and is taking his prescribed medications. Physical examination reveals scattered ronchi bilaterally on the lung exam, edema in the lower extremities, and tenderness in the elbows upon palpation. Chest x-ray results show no signs of pneumonia or airspace disease. Diabetic labs reveal an elevated hemoglobin A1c of eight. The doctor suspects a viral upper respiratory infection and plans to conduct a COVID test. The doctor suggests taking robitussin for the cough and ibuprofen or Tylenol for fever. Regarding the patient's depression, the doctor suggests considering medication or psychotherapy in the future. The doctor plans to increase Andrew's metformin dosage for his diabetes and orders another hemoglobin A1c test in four months. The patient's high blood pressure is being well-managed with lisinopril, and a lipid panel is ordered. The doctor schedules a follow-up appointment in four months and advises the patient to seek further medical attention if symptoms worsen.",

He presents today with an upper respiratory infection.\n\nThe patient reports that he has been doing a bit of work out in the yard in the last week or so. He started to feel really tired and short of breath. The patient denies coughing up anything, but he feels like he will soon be coughing up phlegm. He denies having a fever, but he felt a little warm. He attributed this to exerting himself. He reports that his elbows hurt quite a bit.

He was a little concerned about that, but for the most part, he has been doing well with it. His wife got him into barre classes and this has been relaxing.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, he has been monitoring his sugar levels while he is at work, but is not as consistent on Saturdays and Sundays. His diet has been pretty good for the most part, except for some house parties. They have not been elevated since his respiratory symptoms began.\n\nThe patient has been monitoring his blood pressure at home.
