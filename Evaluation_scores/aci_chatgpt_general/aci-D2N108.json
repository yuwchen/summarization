    "Summary:\nThe patient, Gregory, has had a nonhealing foot ulcer for two months. The ulcer has recently become red and is draining. The patient believes they may have gotten the ulcer from walking barefoot on the beach. They have not picked up antibiotics prescribed by their primary care physician (PCP) yet. The patient has diabetes, but their blood sugar is not regularly checked and their last A1C was around 10, indicating poor control. The doctor examines the foot and finds a circular wound with redness, drainage, and edema. There is no bone infection present, based on an x-ray. The doctor plans to order an ankle brachial index (ABI) to assess blood supply and perform a debridement to remove dead tissue. The patient will be prescribed clindamycin for the infection and will be given a surgical shoe to relieve pressure on the foot. They will return in two weeks for a follow-up. The doctor advises the patient to call the office if any issues arise between appointments, and to seek urgent care or the ER for emergencies.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight foot ulcer.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nGregory Hernandez is a pleasant 40-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a non-healing right foot ulcer. Onset of ulcer was approximately 2 months ago after walking barefoot on the beach. He reports the ulcer has recently become red and is draining. At times he will also experience throbbing pain. He has seen his primary care physician and was prescribed antibiotics, however, he has not started them yet and does not recall the name of the medication.\n\nThe patient is a diabetic. He is taking medication for this, however, he does not monitor his blood sugar consistently. His last A1C was around 10.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of diabetes.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain.\nSkin: Reports right foot ulcer with redness and drainage.\n\nVITALS\n\nVital signs are normal.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the right foot: There is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect laterally just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some redness and drainage present as well as edema. No necrosis, odor, or bony exposure. Nontender to palpation.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight diabetic foot ulcer.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index to determine the blood supply in his foot. Debridement will be performed. A prescription for clindamycin 400 mg 2 times per day for 7 days will be provided as he does seem to have an infection. He will also be placed in a surgical shoe to provide increased support for the next month.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress and for possible repeat debridement. He has been advised to call the office if his symptoms worsen and we will get him in sooner, however, if he starts to develop a fever or necrosis he has been instructed to go to the ER.\n",
