    "\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n The patient is a new patient who fell five months ago going up the stairs, and he has had pain in his left shoulder and elbow since. He has had constant pain in his left shoulder and left elbow for about five months. The pain is worse when he lifts weights. He stopped hitting the gym because of the pain. He has not taken anything for the pain.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n The doctor gently pressed around the patient's shoulder and elbow to see where the pain might be stemming from. The left shoulder and elbow were tender to palpation, but there was no warmth, erythema, or deformity. Positive Hawkin's-Kennedy and Neer's tests were noted. Normal proximal and distal upper extremity strength was noted. The patient's intact median radial ulnar sensation and abduction to 90 degrees were noted. Normal empty can test was noted.  \nRESULTS\n Impingement syndrome of left shoulder was diagnosed.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The doctor recommended physical therapy twice a week, as well as any other exercises given to do at home. If the pain did not improve, then a cortisone injection would be considered. The doctor requested a referral order for Dr. Martha Rivera to be in physical therapy two days per week. The patient will continue to ice his shoulder and rest as much as possible. The patient was instructed to give the doctor a call or email if his symptoms worsened or did not improve with the therapy.",
