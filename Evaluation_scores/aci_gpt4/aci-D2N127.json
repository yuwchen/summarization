    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 32-year-old male who presents with neck pain following multiple car crashes, the most recent one in February of this year. He reports severe, sharp, incapacitating pain that radiates to his left arm and right leg, as well as headaches, dizziness, numbness, and spasms. He has a history of neck surgery and fentanyl use, but has not had a prescription for several weeks. He is under the care of a therapist, a lawyer, and another provider named Pamela.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n  The patient has pain on palpation of the cervical spine, both on the bony process and on the muscle. He has limited range of motion in all directions, especially flexion and extension. He has no bruising, swelling, or laceration visible. He appears fatigued and distressed.  \nRESULTS\n  The patient had an x-ray of the cervical spine, which showed no fracture. He is scheduled for an MRI to rule out any soft tissue injury or other pathology.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n  The patient is diagnosed with a neck sprain, possibly complicated by previous trauma and opioid dependence. He is prescribed robaxin 1500 mg every 6 to 8 hours for muscle relaxation and pain relief. He is advised to apply ice and heat as needed, and to perform gentle neck exercises daily. He is referred to physical therapy and pain medicine for further evaluation and possible local injections. He is given a work excuse until the MRI results are available. He is instructed to follow up with the provider after the MRI, and to contact the office if his pain worsens or he develops any new symptoms. He is also encouraged to continue his therapy and legal consultations.",
