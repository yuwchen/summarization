The pain is a seven on a scale from one to ten, and the pain is felt in the back of the neck. There is pain when the patient moves their neck, and headaches were experienced early on but not currently.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n The doctor performed a physical examination, palpating the soft tissues of the patient's neck and back. There was positive pain to palpation of the soft tissues of the neck but not the back or shoulders. There was also positive pain with flexion, severe positive pain to extension, positive pain with rotation, and positive pain on lateral bending.  \nRESULTS\n X-ray results showed no signs of fracture or bony abnormalities.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The doctor believes that the patient has neck strain and will prescribe anti-inflammatory medication (motrin 600mg) and a muscle relaxant (flexeril 10mg) as needed. The patient is advised to avoid straining the neck further and to relax it as much as possible. An MRI will also be ordered to rule out a concussion, and referral to physical rehab or chiropractic treatment will be considered once MRI results are available.",

His pain level is rated at 7 out of 10. When taking ibuprofen he states his pain improves to 5 out of 10. He finds that neck range of motion exacerbates his pain.
