    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 34-year-old female with a history of hypertension, who presents with back pain for six days. She reports walking for 30 minutes to an hour daily and lifting weights three times a week. She denies any trauma or injury prior to the onset of the pain. She describes the pain as a spasm in the lower back, affecting both sides equally. She has been taking ibuprofen and applying heat, but with minimal relief. She denies any numbness, tingling, or weakness in the lower extremities. She has been monitoring her blood pressure at home and following a low-salt diet. She has seasonal allergies, but no other symptoms.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n Vital signs are stable and within normal limits. Heart exam reveals a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, unchanged from previous visits. Lung exam is clear. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Back exam shows tenderness on the right lateral aspect of the lumbar spine, and pain with flexion and extension. Straight leg raise is negative bilaterally. Neurological exam is normal.  \nRESULTS\n Lumbar spine x-ray shows no fracture or malalignment. CBC, CMP, and urinalysis are normal.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The patient has a lumbar strain, likely related to her physical activity. She is prescribed meloxicam 15 mg once daily, and advised to ice and heat the area as needed. She is referred to physical therapy for strengthening exercises. She is also diagnosed with hypertension, well controlled on lisinopril 10 mg daily. She is given a refill of the medication and instructed to continue monitoring her blood pressure and following a low-salt diet. She is advised to follow up as needed.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nBack pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMs. Ramirez is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain.\n\nThe patient reports she has been walking a lot lately, 30 minutes to an hour or so a day. While walking 6 days ago, she felt her back seize up on her. She is not sure what caused it but thinks she was walking a little faster than usual. She describes the sensation as a spasm. She has been taking ibuprofen and using heat on it but it is still pretty stiff. She denies any known trauma or injury to her back. She notes she has been weightlifting around 3 times a week. She did do deadlifts that day before her walk and thinks she may have been using her back more than her legs to lift. She locates the pain in her mid lower back. She denies any lower extremity numbness, tingling, and weakness.\n\nRegarding her hypertension, she states she has been doing readings at home and that has been looking great. She has been watching her diet which has helped. She is taking lisinopril.\n\nThe patient endorses nasal congestion, which she attributes to her seasonal allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from seasonal allergies.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses bilateral low back pain and stiffness.\n\u2022 Neurological: Denies numbness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Pain to palpation along the right lateral aspect of her lumbar spine.
