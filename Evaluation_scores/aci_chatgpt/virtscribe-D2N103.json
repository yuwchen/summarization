    " \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n Melissa Sanchez is seen in the office for status post mitral valve repair done on 8/3/2020. At her previous follow-up on 9/17, she was doing well from a cardiac standpoint. However, she reported chest pains and shallow breathing that last only a few minutes and go away for a couple weeks. She takes her medication regularly, which includes coumadin, lasix, and atenolol. An ECG taken on 12/26/2020 shows atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.    \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n Melissa is examined in a supine position with clear percussion and auscultation on her lungs. Her breath has been reduced, and there is no jugular venous distention. Rhythm of the heart is irregularly irregular. The heart valves are functional, and there is a slight accentuation of the S1. The patient's extremities show trace peripheral edema.   \nRESULTS\n A recent ECG taken on 12/26/2020 shows atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.    \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n Melissa has a history of mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, asthma, and chest discomfort. She is currently taking coumadin, lasix, and atenolol with no side effects. Melissa will continue on her current meds, and she will be seen again in about six to nine months for follow-up.",
