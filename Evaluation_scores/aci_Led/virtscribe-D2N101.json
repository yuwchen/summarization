PLAN After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that the typical approach to a breast reduction is to document her symptoms, symptoms, and pictures, and then they will be submitted to the insurance company for review and possible approval. We discussed that typically, we will take pictures of the breast, elevate the nipple position, and remove any extra fat and breash breast tissue, so that the breast will become smaller in size. She was advised that approximately 30% of the patients can not breastfeed after the reduction. We also discussed that the breasts will enlarge, especially if she can breastfeed. I advised her that after she has children, her breasts will also enlarge and appear deflated. She will have some activity restrictions for about 6 weeks after surgery, including no heavy lifting. I also advised her to avoid driving for 2 to 3 weeks. The drains stay in for about a week. At this point, she has not met with anyone prior to this consult, but I believe she is a good candidate for this procedure and I think she will benefit from it as well. I recommend that we proceed with the breast reduction as soon as her insurance is switched over. We will submit the documentation to the Insurance company in the form of a referral to a new provider, and once that is completed, the patient will be able to follow up with me again right before the surgery to discuss any last minute questions.
