    "\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n Mr. Albert, a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and a kidney transplant, presented to the emergency room with high blood sugar readings and dizziness over the weekend. He had not been monitoring his blood sugar closely, and was grabbing fast food while his mother was hospitalized.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n Blood pressure, pulse, and heart rate were normal, lungs sounded clear, with 1+ edema in his lower extremities. Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur was noted.  \nRESULTS\n Glucose level was 162, and hemoglobin a1c was slightly elevated at 8.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n Hyperglycemia will be treated by increasing Mr. Albert's lantus to 20 units at night. Blood sugar readings will continue to be monitored and his hemoglobin a1c will be checked again in a couple of months. It was decided that his current strategy of meditation was sufficient to manage his depression, therefore medication or therapy will be delayed until further notice. His kidney transplant is stable and he will continue to follow-up with Dr. Reyes, who will manage his immunosuppression medication.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nER follow-up.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAlbert Powell is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant. He is here today for an emergency room follow-up.\n\nThe patient states he was not staying on top of his blood sugar readings and felt \" woozy \" over the weekend. His wife was concerned that his levels were elevated and wanted to take him to the emergency room. He was not admitted to the hospital. He reports that his mother is in the hospital and he has been eating poorly. He was not monitoring his blood sugars and what he was eating. When they got home from the visit he felt a lot better. Since then, he has been following his diet pretty closely. He continues Lantus insulin at bedtime.\n\nRegarding his kidney transplant and has been doing pretty well. The patient has been pretty diligent about taking immunotherapy medication and following orders. The last time he saw Dr. Reyes was about 3 weeks ago and everything seemed to be fine.\n\nRegarding his depression, the patient states it has been about a year and a half, but he has been pretty good with that. He has his moments, but as long as he finds some time to relax in the afternoon and then it seems to work out. He thinks he would probably want to continue that at least for a couple more months and see how it goes. His wife got him into meditation recently and he finds that relaxing so he feels he would like to continue that for a couple more months and see how it goes.\n\nThe patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or dizziness.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.\n\u2022 Neurological: Denies lightheadedness or dizziness.\n\u2022 Psychiatric: Endorses depression.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Constitutional: in no apparent distress.\n\u2022 Neck: No carotid bruits appreciable.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: 1+ edema in the bilateral lower extremities.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFasting glucose is elevated at 162.\nHemoglobin A1c is elevated at 8.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nAlbert Powell is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and kidney transplant. He is here today for an emergency room follow-up.\n\nHyperglycemia.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: He was recently seen in the emergency department with elevated blood glucose levels. He admits to dietary indiscretion prior to this, but has since improved his diet.
