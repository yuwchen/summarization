    "Patient Name: Randy Gutierrez\nDate of Birth: 8/10/2020\n\nSummary:\nThe doctor spoke with the patient's guest about Randy's symptoms. Randy has had a runny nose and stuffiness since last night. His mucus is currently clear. Randy also has a cough, pulls on his ears, and rubs his nose. He had a rectal temperature of 100.3, indicating a low-grade fever. Randy had a decreased appetite and seemed irritable. His energy level was high, but he had difficulty falling asleep. His older sister and a playmate with a sinus infection have been exposed to him. The guest has been using saline mist, Tylenol, baby Vick's, and a humidifier to alleviate Randy's symptoms. The doctor examined Randy's breathing, ears, and cradle cap. The cradle cap has worsened, and the guest has been using a cradle cap brush and regular Aveeno shampoo. The doctor prescribed medication for a potential barky cough and advised against giving honey. The guest also asked about treating cradle cap. The doctor recommended using regular strength dandruff shampoo twice a week and cautioned about avoiding contact with the eyes. The guest was instructed to monitor Randy's symptoms and return for a follow-up appointment.",
