    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 35-year-old male who presents with acute low back pain and right foot tingling that started yesterday after raking leaves in his yard. He has a history of a similar episode three years ago that resolved spontaneously. He has tried ice and ibuprofen without relief. He reports that the pain is worse with flexion and better with sitting and a hot shower. His partner is present and concerned about the severity of the pain and the possibility of a long-term injury.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n The patient is alert and oriented. His vital signs are within normal limits. His low back shows tenderness to palpation at the L5 level. His range of motion is limited by pain. His neurological exam is normal except for some tingling in his right foot. His strength, reflexes, and sensation are intact in both lower extremities. His pulses are equal and symmetrical.  \nRESULTS\n The patient had a plain x-ray of his lumbar spine that showed no acute fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The patient is diagnosed with a lumbar sprain and possible radiculopathy. He is prescribed meloxicam for pain and inflammation and referred to physical therapy for exercises and stretching. He is advised to rest his back, avoid heavy lifting and twisting, and use ice and heat as needed. He is instructed to follow up in two weeks or sooner if his symptoms worsen or do not improve. He is reassured that his x-ray is normal and that an MRI is not indicated at this time unless there is evidence of progressive neurological deficit or intractable pain. His partner is educated about the natural course of low back pain and the importance of compliance with the treatment plan.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLow back pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBryan Brooks is a pleasant 39-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of low back pain. He is accompanied today by his partner.\n\nApproximately 2 hours after he finished raking leaves yesterday, the patient began to feel a tightening sensation in his low back and tingling in his right foot. Prior to this, he recalls a similar episode approximately 3 years ago in which his symptoms resolved after 1 day. Ice and Advil provided no relief, but his pain is less severe when he is in a seated position and taking a hot shower helped alleviate his pain. The patient's partner reports that his pain seems to worsen when he stands up.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports low back pain.\nNeurological: Reports tingling in the right foot.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNEURO: Normal strength and sensation.\nMSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain on extension. Some pain with flexion. Pain with palpation around L5. Dorsiflexion is normal. Pulses are equal in all extremities.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays obtained and reviewed in office today were normal.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLow back sprain.\n\nPLAN\n\nThe examination findings and x-ray results were discussed with the patient and his partner today. I recommend we treat this conservatively with rest, meloxicam, and formal physical therapy. If he fails to improve, we can consider obtaining an MRI for further evaluation.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up in 2 weeks.",
