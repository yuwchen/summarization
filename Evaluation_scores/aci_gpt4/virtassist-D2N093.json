    "A possible clinical note is  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Lawrence is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type I diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux, who presents with complaints of shortness of breath for 10 days. He attributes his symptoms to dietary indiscretion, especially salty foods. He reports feeling lethargic and swollen in his legs. He has difficulty lying flat in bed and woke up acutely short of breath once a week ago. He denies chest pain, fever, chills, cough, or abdominal pain. He is on an insulin pump and monitors his blood sugars regularly, except on weekends. He has a history of chocolate bar consumption. He has tried natural solutions for his depression, such as stretching outdoors, but has not been consistent. He is not interested in medications for his depression. He is on omeprazole for his reflux and has cut back on his red bull, caffeine, and alcohol intake.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n Vital signs are stable and pulse oximetry is normal. Neck exam reveals no jugular venous distension or carotid bruits. Heart exam reveals a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur. Lung exam reveals bilateral crackles at the bases. Lower extremity exam reveals 1+ pitting edema.  \nRESULTS\n Chest x-ray shows no evidence of airspace disease. Labs show no leukocytosis or anemia. Hemoglobin A1c is pending.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n  - Acute heart failure exacerbation Start lasix 40 mg daily, monitor weight daily, call if weight is not decreasing or increasing, or if shortness of breath worsens. Advise to avoid salty foods and fluids. Refer to cardiology for further evaluation and management. - Type I diabetes Order hemoglobin A1c in one month, follow up with endocrinology, ensure eye exam is up to date. Educate on the importance of blood sugar monitoring and insulin adjustment. - Depression Refer to psychiatry for talk therapy, no medications at this time. Encourage exercise and social support. - Reflux Continue omeprazole 20 mg daily, avoid triggers such as red bull, caffeine, and alcohol.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nShortness of breath.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nLawrence Walker is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 1 diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux, who presents with complaints of shortness of breath.\n\nThe patient states he has had some shortness of breath and mild leg swelling which he thinks has to do with eating some salty foods at some house parties recently. His shortness of breath is primarily with exertion such as walking up the stairs. This has been going on for about 10 days now. He woke from sleep once with shortness of breath about a week ago. He also notes discomfort lying flat in bed and musculoskeletal stiffness in the morning. He states that it takes him a little while to get up.\n\nRegarding his type 1 diabetes, he is using his insulin pump. He has been consistently monitoring his blood sugars during the working week, but notes that he checks less on the weekends, due to being busy. He is trying to avoid sugar but admits to an affinity for chocolate bars.\n\nRegarding his depression, he states that it has been a crazy year and a half. He has tried some natural solutions. In the summer, he did daily outdoor stretching, which was great; but now that the weather has changed, he needs to find some alternatives. He is not ready to try any medications. He denies suicidal and homicidal ideation.\n\nRegarding his GERD, he is taking his omeprazole. He has made some lifestyle modifications like cutting back on his red bull intake and other caffeine. Reducing his alcohol intake has been tough during the holiday season, but he is getting better about this.\n\nThe patient denies chest pain, fever, chills, cough, and abdominal pain.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills.\u00a0 Endorses fatigue.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
