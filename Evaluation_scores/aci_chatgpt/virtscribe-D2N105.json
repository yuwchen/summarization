    " \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n  Diana Scott, a new patient, came in for a visit because she was recently diagnosed with a new heart murmur. She does not know the type or severity of the heart murmur, but she is worried about it. She denies having chest pain, but she does experience shortness of breath and leg pain. Diana Scott reports feeling lightheaded and dizzy when she is standing up, which is relieved by meclizine medication. Her ankles also swell at times. Her legs have been in severe pain for a month now. She has lost some weight recently, and she does not have any significant history of fevers or chills.    \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n  For the physical exam, Diana Scott was found to be normal for age and had no acute distress. She was deemed to be in good cardiovascular condition, but she had a 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids. Her neurologic gait was normal for age.   \nRESULTS\n   EKG showed that Diana Scott was in sinus rhythm but with frequent PVCs, as well as an anterior septum infarct pattern. Diana Scott was suggested to undergo an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. The echocardiogram is meant to help determine the severity of her aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis may be contributing to her recent symptoms. Diana Scott's s2 is relatively preserved, which would be more consistent with moderate.    \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n   Diana Scott was found to have a systolic murmur, which might be due to aortic stenosis. She also has PVCs and possible ischemia. Diana Scott was scheduled to undergo an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on the results of the echocardiogram and the severity of her aortic stenosis, her doctors will decide whether an ischemic evaluation or further monitoring is necessary. She will follow up in three to four weeks after her echocardiogram results are in. There is a possibility that a TAVR evaluation will be considered if the aortic stenosis is severe. Lastly, it was suggested that Diana Scott's statin medication might not be necessary, but she should discuss it with her PCP.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHeart murmur.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nDiana Scott is a 100-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of a heart murmur.\n\nMs. Scott has been recently diagnosed with a \u201cnew, worrisome\u201d heart murmur. She denies chest pain, syncope, palpitations, fevers, or chills. She reports shortness of breath if she walks too fast, too long, or tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. The patient requires a walker and can walk around her cul-de-sac or to the end of the driveway without shortness of breath. Compared to 6 months ago, her functioning has declined 20-30%. Prior to 6 months, symptoms were absent. For the past month she has been experiencing severe, bilateral leg pain, which was limiting her mobility. She did see her doctor last week who completed a chest x-ray and prescribed pain medicine. Occasionally, she feels dizzy but takes medication for this and it subsides. Her ankles have been swelling for the past 6 months, but the swelling fluctuates day to day. Her weight has been slowly decreasing over the past year, with her current weight at 120 pounds, previous weight was 130 pounds. She also reports feeling \u201coverly tired\u201d but attributes this to her polypharmacy.\n\nThe patient is unsure if she has completed any cardiovascular testing.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHyperlipidemia.\nHypertension.\nHypothyroid.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nRequires a walker to ambulate.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nSon had a myocardial infarction.\nBrother had a stroke and has diabetes.\nOlder sister has an unknown heart problem.\nFamily is positive for heart disease.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nLevothyroxine.\nLisinopril.\nSimvastatin 20 mg.\nMeclizine.\nAmlodipine.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nElderly, no acute distress.\n\nCardiovascular\nNormal S1, S2 preserved, irregular rhythm and normal rate. 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nLower extremity edema\n\nNeurologic\nGait normal for age.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEKG\nImpression: Sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Cardiac murmur.\n\u2022 PVCs.\n\u2022 Hypertension.\n\u2022 Hyperlipidemia.\n\u2022 Hypothyroid.\n\u2022 Lightheadedness/dizziness.\n\nPLAN\n\nCardiac murmur\nDiana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. She does have symptoms including a significant increase in fatigue over the last 6 months, shortness of breath, and some lightheadedness. This could be due to severe aortic stenosis, however, her S2 is relatively preserved which would be more consistent with moderate. She is unsure if she has had an echocardiogram, although some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction, so it is possible that she had one as some point in the past. We will order a repeat echocardiogram today to assess overall cardiac structure and function as well as valvular disease. If she does truly have severe aortic stenosis, I briefly discussed a TAVR procedure today as she is not a candidate for a surgical AVR given her age co-morbidities and frailty. She is unsure if she would be interested in this, but we will assess first with the echocardiogram and then discuss further at follow-up. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.\n\nPVCs\nHer referral mentions tachycardia. Her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations. We will check an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or possibly a heart monitor to assess the overall burden of PVCs. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only.\n\nHypertension\nShe is taking amlodipine and lisinopril. We will continue these as is.\n\nHyperlipidemia\nThis is managed by her PCP. She is on simvastatin 20 mg. She is having bilateral leg pain over the past month. This could be related to the simvastatin possibly and given her age, it would not be unreasonable to stop the simvastatin, but I will defer to her PCP. She has no known CAD but if we were to do a TAVR evaluation and this was discovered, a statin would be indicated.\n\nHypothyroidism\nShe takes levothyroxine for supplementation and will continue this as is.\n\nLightheadedness/dizziness\nShe is on meclizine for this. It is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness are related to the aortic stenosis, and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above. She is also having some PVCs on her EKG, which could be contributing, but she does not feel palpitations. We will consider a monitor but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow-up in 3 to 4 weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps.\n",
