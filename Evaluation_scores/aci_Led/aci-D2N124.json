We explained that that includes plate and screws placed in. I explained that he will be out for a little bit and may have to sit for a long period of time as well. We will prescribe meloxicam to treat the swelling. I advised the patient to ice and elevate his ankle regularly. In the meantime, we will continue coaching him for the next 3 months and then within that 3 months we will get him back out doing some exercise again. 2.
