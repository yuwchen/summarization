    "Summary:\n\nThe patient, Kyle, initially went to see his primary care physician (PCP) for a cough, which was diagnosed as bronchitis. However, a chest x-ray revealed a lung nodule, which was confirmed by a CT scan. Kyle was then referred to the doctor he is currently seeing for further evaluation. Kyle expresses his nervousness about the situation.\n\nThe doctor assures Kyle that they will work together as a team and offers support to alleviate his nervousness. They discuss the duration of Kyle's cough, which started about three months ago after he loaded hay while taking care of his horses. Kyle mentions that he exercises frequently, especially biking, and rarely gets sick. The cough has since gone away.\n\nThe doctor shares their own love for biking and the new trails in the area. They promise to help Kyle and even suggest going for a bike ride together. The doctor then asks about Kyle's rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and how he manages it. Kyle mentions taking methotrexate and staying active, with occasional problems in his hands but no recent flares.\n\nThe doctor notes that Kyle had previously smoked but has quit seven years ago, which is good for his health. They inquire about any pain or shortness of breath, to which Kyle responds negatively. The doctor asks about family history, specifically any lung cancer or other malignancies, to which Kyle mentions his mother's breast cancer but states that she is doing well.\n\nThe doctor proceeds with a physical examination, finding no abnormalities except for minor swelling in Kyle's knuckles due to his RA. The doctor reviews the results of the chest CT, which showed a two-centimeter nodule in the right upper lobe of Kyle's lung. They note its smooth appearance and the absence of emphysematous disease.\n\nBased on their assessment, the doctor recommends conducting pulmonary function tests (PFT) to establish a baseline for lung function and schedules a PET-CT scan to determine the metabolic activity of the nodule, which can indicate if it's cancerous or inflammatory. The doctor proposes removing the nodule through video-assisted thoracoscopy, which would involve three small incisions on the side of Kyle's right chest. They will use a camera and scope to remove the nodule and a small portion of the lung under general anesthesia. Kyle would stay in the hospital for one night and have a chest tube until the following day.\n\nRegarding his RA, the doctor advises Kyle to continue following up with his rheumatologist and adhering to his medication therapy. The doctor asks if Kyle has any questions or concerns, to which Kyle expresses his fear but acknowledges that he will be okay. The doctor reassures him and goes to get the necessary paperwork to proceed with treatment.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nCough.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports a history of rheumatoid arthritis. He denies any previous history of lung infections or pneumonia.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports he stopped smoking tobacco 7 years ago and has felt better since doing so. He notes that he enjoys biking.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nPatient reports his mother has a history of breast cancer, but is doing well. He denies any family history of lung cancer.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports taking methotrexate 7.5 mg every week.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nRespiratory: Denies cough or shortness of breath.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood Pressure: 124/76 mmHg.\nHeart Rate: 70 beats per minute.\nRespiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.\nOxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.\nBody Temperature: Afebrile.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nRespiratory\n- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear and equal bilaterally.\n\nCardiovascular\n- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No clicks, rubs, or murmurs. Pulses are intact in all extremities.\n\nMusculoskeletal\n- Examination: No lower extremity edema. Mild swelling to the 3rd digit knuckles on the bilateral hands, consistent with RA.\n\nIntegumentary\n- Examination: Skin is pink, warm, and dry. Capillary refill is brisk.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCT scan of chest, obtained at an outside facility, is reviewed today and demonstrates a solitary 2 cm nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe. It appears the nodule is smooth in appearance. No evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Right upper lobe lung nodule.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient has incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule visible on his chest CT. It could be a benign nodule, but because of his smoking history, I think it is best that he has it surgically removed.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. Surgery will require general anesthesia and will take approximately 1.5 hours. I explained to the patient that his procedure will consist of 3 small incisions being made on the side of his right chest. I will then insert a camera and scope to assist in removing the nodule along with a very small portion of his lung. He was advised that he will be admitted for most likely an overnight stay. He will have a chest tube in until the following day when I remove it at his bedside. All questions were answered.\n- Medical Treatment: Pulmonary function test ordered today to obtain patient's baseline. PET CT will also be scheduled to determine if the nodule is metabolically active, which can suggest if it is cancerous or inflammatory. Nodule will be removed via video assisted thoracoscopy.\n\n2. Rheumatoid arthritis.\n- Medical Reasoning: Stable.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue to follow up with his rheumatologist.\n- Medical Treatment: Continue medication therapy and routine follow up with rheumatologist as previously outlined.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n",
