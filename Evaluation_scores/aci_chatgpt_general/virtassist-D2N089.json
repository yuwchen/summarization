    "The patient, Andrea, is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and reflux. She presents for her annual exam. Andrea reports that she has been doing well, with no joint pain or issues with her medication (methotrexate). However, she has been experiencing palpitations related to her atrial fibrillation, especially when stressed. She has been trying meditation and exercise to relieve stress but with limited success. Her reflux symptoms have improved with medication (protonix) and dietary modifications. Physical examination reveals a slight systolic ejection murmur, clear lungs, and pain in her right elbow. Event monitor results show that Andrea is in and out of atrial fibrillation. Autoimmune panel results indicate well-controlled rheumatoid arthritis. The doctor plans to continue Andrea on methotrexate for her rheumatoid arthritis, refer her to cardiology for a cardiac ablation to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and continue protonix for reflux along with dietary modifications. Andrea will also be provided with a refill for methotrexate.",

It has been a year since she was last seen.\n\nThe patient states she is doing well. She has been walking, exercising, and doing yoga, which has helped with her arthritis. She denies issues with stiffness, pain, or flare ups over the last year. The patient has continued utilizing methotrexate 2.5 mg once a week and denies issues with that.\n\nIn terms of her atrial fibrillation, she endorses continued palpitations. The last episode she had was about 1 week ago. She has noticed that when she starts to get stressed they start to flare up again. She has tried meditation and running with her dog for stress relief, however these have not been helpful. The patient had called last month and had an event monitor done.\n\nRegarding her GERD, she has continued to utilize Protonix 40 mg a day. The patient has cut out soda, which seemed to help. She has not had a flare up in over 5 months.\n\nThe patient endorses nasal congestion because of her allergies. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and vomitting.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from allergies.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea. Endorses palpitations.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Denies joint pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: No lower extremity edema. Edema and erythema of the right elbow. Pain to palpation of the right elbow.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEvent monitor: Positive for conversion pause.\n\nAutoimmune panel: Normal.

It has been a year since she was last seen.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: The patient has remained active and has been compliant with methotrexate once weekly. Her recent autoimmune panel was normal.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: She will continue on methotrexate 2.5 mg once weekly. This was refilled today.\n\u2022 Specialist Referrals: If she needs a referral back to the rheumatologist, she will let me know.\n\nAtrial fibrillation.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: She continues to experience episodes of palpitations. Her most recent episode was about 1 week ago. She is in normal sinus rhythm today, but her recent cardiac event monitor demonstrated a conversion pause.\n\u2022 Specialist Referrals: We will refer her to cardiology for a cardiac ablation.\n\nGERD.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: She has been compliant with dietary modifications and denies any episodes in approximately 5 months.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: Continue on Protonix 40 mg daily.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: She could continue with dietary modifications and avoid known dietary triggers.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n",
