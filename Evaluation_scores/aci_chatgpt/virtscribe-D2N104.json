    "\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n Judy Gomez, a patient with psoriatic arthritis, came to the doctor's office to continue her ongoing management. During the conversation, it was revealed that Judy was doing good since the last visit, but there were some days when she had to take an extra prednisone for pain in her feet. The doctor recommended discontinuing the use of prednisone since it is causing more harm than good. Additionally, Judy reported that methotrexate helped with her joint pain but interfered with the COVID vaccine.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n The doctor conducted a physical exam and found that Judy had some joint pain and bruises that showed up from prednisone use. The doctor recommended discontinuing the use of prednisone, which might relieve Judy from the prednisone-related bruises. Additionally, the doctor found ridges in Judy's nails from psoriasis.  \nRESULTS\n The results showed that the treatment was progressing well, and Judy needed to stop prednisone and continue with methotrexate. She needed to get a blood test done before her next visit.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n Based on the conversation, the assessment was that Judy's psoriatic arthritis was progressing well, and the plan was to discontinue prednisone and continue with methotrexate. The doctor recommended a blood test for Judy. Follow-up is scheduled for three months.",
