    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nUpper respiratory infection.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAndrew Campbell is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. He presents today with an upper respiratory infection.\n\nThe patient reports that he has been doing a bit of work out in the yard in the last week or so. He started to feel really tired and short of breath. The patient denies coughing up anything, but he feels like he will soon be coughing up phlegm. He denies having a fever, but he felt a little warm. He attributed this to exerting himself. He reports that his elbows hurt quite a bit. He notes his knees were pretty tired and he felt some tension around his knees. The patient attributes these symptoms to lifting heavy bags. He has not been wearing a mask as much recently. He believes that he caught his first cold and his symptoms have worsened. He has had both of his COVID vaccinations.\n\nHe denies any history of seasonal allergies.\n\nRegarding his depression, he states it has been a crazy year and a half. He was a little concerned about that, but for the most part, he has been doing well with it. His wife got him into barre classes and this has been relaxing.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, he has been monitoring his sugar levels while he is at work, but is not as consistent on Saturdays and Sundays. His diet has been pretty good for the most part, except for some house parties. They have not been elevated since his respiratory symptoms began.\n\nThe patient has been monitoring his blood pressure at home. He reports that he is very regular with monitoring his blood pressure during the week, though less consistently on weekends. He reports his blood pressure has been under control. He has continued to utilize lisinopril 20 mg, daily.\n\nThe patient denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Constitutional: Denies fever.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Endorses dyspnea on exertion.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Endorses shortness of breath and cough.\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal: Denies nausea or diarrhea.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses bilateral elbow and knee pain.\n\u2022 Psychiatric: Endorses depression.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Respiratory: Scattered rhonchi bilaterally, clears with cough.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No extra heart sounds.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Edema in the bilateral lower extremities. Pain to palpation of the bilateral elbows.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray of the chest is unremarkable. No airspace disease. No signs of pneumonia.\n\nHemoglobin A1c is elevated at 8.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nAndrew Campbell is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. He presents today with an upper respiratory infection.\n\nUpper respiratory infection.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: I believe he has contracted a viral syndrome. His chest x-ray was unremarkable and he has received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccination.\n\u2022 Additional Testing: We will obtain a COVID-19 test to rule this out.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: I recommend he use Robitussin for cough, as well as ibuprofen or Tylenol if he develops a fever.\n\nDepression.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: He has been practicing barre classes and is doing well overall.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: I offered medication or psychotherapy, but the patient opted to defer at this time.\n\nDiabetes type 2.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: His blood glucose levels have been well controlled based on home monitoring, but his recent hemoglobin A1c was elevated.\n\u2022 Additional Testing: We will repeat a hemoglobin A1c in 4 months.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: We will increase his metformin to 1000 mg twice daily.\n\nHypertension.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with lisinopril and his blood pressures have been well controlled based on home monitoring.\n\u2022 Additional Testing: We will order a lipid panel.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: He will continue on lisinopril 20 mg once daily.
