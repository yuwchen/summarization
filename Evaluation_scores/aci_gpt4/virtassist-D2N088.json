He presents today with an upper respiratory infection.\n\nThe patient reports that he has been doing a bit of work out in the yard in the last week or so. He started to feel really tired and short of breath. The patient denies coughing up anything, but he feels like he will soon be coughing up phlegm. He denies having a fever, but he felt a little warm. He attributed this to exerting himself. He reports that his elbows hurt quite a bit.

He believes that he caught his first cold and his symptoms have worsened. He has had both of his COVID vaccinations.\n\nHe denies any history of seasonal allergies.\n\nRegarding his depression, he states it has been a crazy year and a half. He was a little concerned about that, but for the most part, he has been doing well with it. His wife got him into barre classes and this has been relaxing.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, he has been monitoring his sugar levels while he is at work, but is not as consistent on Saturdays and Sundays. His diet has been pretty good for the most part, except for some house parties.
