    "\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n Andrea is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history significant for rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and reflux who presents today for her annual exam. She reports doing well after walking and yoga exercises and has no joint pain recently. However, she has been experiencing palpitations related to stress and allergies causing nasal congestion.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n The vital signs show a controlled heart rate. On the heart examination, there is a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. Lungs are clear. There is edema and erythema on the right elbow and tenderness on palpation. There is no lower extremity edema.  \nRESULTS\n The autoimmune panel shows everything is well-controlled with rheumatoid arthritis on the methotrexate, and the event monitor results show that Andrea is in and out of a-fib, and has a conversion pause.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The plan includes continuing the methotrexate, 2.5 mg once weekly, referring Andrea to cardiology for a cardiac ablation to map out the source of the rhythm and avoid going in and out of a-fib. In addition, protonix, 40 mg a day, along with dietary modifications, will help manage reflux. Andrea will have a refill of methotrexate, and a referral to cardiology.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nAnnual exam.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAndrea Roberts is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history significant for rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and reflux, who presents today for her annual exam. It has been a year since she was last seen.\n\nThe patient states she is doing well. She has been walking, exercising, and doing yoga, which has helped with her arthritis. She denies issues with stiffness, pain, or flare ups over the last year. The patient has continued utilizing methotrexate 2.5 mg once a week and denies issues with that.\n\nIn terms of her atrial fibrillation, she endorses continued palpitations. The last episode she had was about 1 week ago. She has noticed that when she starts to get stressed they start to flare up again. She has tried meditation and running with her dog for stress relief, however these have not been helpful. The patient had called last month and had an event monitor done.\n\nRegarding her GERD, she has continued to utilize Protonix 40 mg a day. The patient has cut out soda, which seemed to help. She has not had a flare up in over 5 months.\n\nThe patient endorses nasal congestion because of her allergies. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and vomitting.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from allergies.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain or dyspnea. Endorses palpitations.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Denies shortness of breath.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Denies joint pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Respiratory: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: No lower extremity edema. Edema and erythema of the right elbow. Pain to palpation of the right elbow.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEvent monitor: Positive for conversion pause.\n\nAutoimmune panel: Normal. Well controlled rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\nAndrea Roberts is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history significant for rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and reflux, who presents today for her annual exam. It has been a year since she was last seen.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: The patient has remained active and has been compliant with methotrexate once weekly. Her recent autoimmune panel was normal.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: She will continue on methotrexate 2.5 mg once weekly.
