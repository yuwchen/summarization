    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Julia Jones is a 25 year old female who presents for a new breast reduction consult. She has been considering this procedure for about six to seven years, due to chronic back pain, neck pain, bra strap indentations, and activity limitations related to her large breasts. She wears a 34E sports bra, but estimates her true size to be a G cup. She has a family history of breast cancer, with her mother diagnosed at age 40. She has no children, but may plan to in the future. She has no history of rashes, nipple pain, or numbness in the hands. She has been seeing a chiropractor for her back pain, and takes propranolol for migraines. She does not smoke, uses alcohol occasionally, and is studying psychology. She recently lost 10 pounds, and would like to lose 20 more. She has Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance, but will be switching to her husband's plan in July.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n Vital signs are within normal limits. Height is 5'6\", weight is 190 lbs, BMI is 30.7. Breast exam reveals asymmetrical breasts with severe ptosis bilaterally. The right breast is lower than the left. There is no nipple retraction or discharge bilaterally. No breast tenderness, masses, or axillary lymphadenopathy is palpable. The sternal notch to nipple distance is 40 cm on the right and 38 cm on the left. The nipple to inframammary fold distance is 28 cm on the right and 26 cm on the left. The base width is 20 cm on the right and 19 cm on the left. The estimated breast volume is 2,000 cc on the right and 1,800 cc on the left.  \nRESULTS\n The patient was counseled on the risks, benefits, and alternatives of bilateral reduction mammoplasty, including the possibility of nipple grafting, loss of sensation, inability to breastfeed, scarring, infection, hematoma, seroma, asymmetry, and need for revision. She was informed of the insurance approval process, the surgical technique, the postoperative care, and the expected outcomes. She was shown preoperative and postoperative photos of similar cases. She expressed understanding and interest in proceeding with the surgery. She had no further questions.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n Symptomatic macromastia, bilateral. Plan to submit for insurance approval once the patient has the new provider information. Plan to perform bilateral reduction mammoplasty with inferior pedicle technique and Wise pattern incision, aiming for a small C cup. Plan to admit the patient overnight for pain control and observation. Plan to follow up in one week for drain removal and wound check. Plan to see the patient again before surgery for final consent and instructions.",
