    "Cheryl, a 34-year-old female with a history of hypertension, presents with back pain. She experienced the pain six days ago after walking for an extended period. She has been taking ibuprofen and applying heat but still experiences stiffness. She has been lifting weights three times a week, including deadlifts. The pain is primarily in the lower back on both sides. There is no numbness, tingling, or weakness in her legs. Cheryl's blood pressure has been well controlled with lisinopril. She has nasal congestion due to seasonal allergies. Physical examination reveals tenderness and pain in the lumbar spine, with pain during flexion and extension. Straight leg raise is negative. X-ray and lab results are normal. The diagnosis is lumbar strain, likely due to lifting or exercise. Treatment includes prescribing meloxicam, applying ice or heat, and referral to physical therapy for strengthening exercises. Cheryl should continue taking lisinopril and report any increases in blood pressure readings. She needs a refill of lisinopril, which the doctor orders.",

While walking 6 days ago, she felt her back seize up on her. She is not sure what caused it but thinks she was walking a little faster than usual. She describes the sensation as a spasm. She has been taking ibuprofen and using heat on it but it is still pretty stiff. She denies any known trauma or injury to her back. She notes she has been weightlifting around 3 times a week. She did do deadlifts that day before her walk and thinks she may have been using her back more than her legs to lift. She locates the pain in her mid lower back. She denies any lower extremity numbness, tingling, and weakness.\n\nRegarding her hypertension, she states she has been doing readings at home and that has been looking great. She has been watching her diet which has helped. She is taking lisinopril.\n\nThe patient endorses nasal congestion, which she attributes to her seasonal allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: Endorses nasal congestion from seasonal allergies.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses bilateral low back pain and stiffness.\n\u2022 Neurological: Denies numbness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, stable.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Pain to palpation along the right lateral aspect of her lumbar spine.
