    "In this dialogue, the patient, Judy Gomez, visits the doctor for ongoing management of her psoriatic arthritis. The doctor asks about her well-being and mentions the previous discussion about decreasing her prednisone dose. Judy confirms that she is now only taking one prednisone pill and reports that it seems to be enough, although she occasionally takes an extra one when experiencing extra pain in her feet. The doctor notes that they are still on track for discontinuing the prednisone and asks about the effectiveness of methotrexate in relieving joint pain. Judy confirms that it helped, but she had to skip a week of methotrexate due to concerns about its interference with a COVID vaccine. She experienced severe symptoms during that week but resumed taking methotrexate and felt better. The doctor expresses the need to monitor methotrexate due to its high-risk nature and mentions the need for blood work in the future. Judy asks about the bruises she is experiencing, and the doctor attributes them to the prednisone, assuring her that they may disappear once she stops taking it. The doctor then examines Judy's joints and concludes that her treatment is progressing well. They decide to discontinue prednisone, continue with methotrexate, and schedule a follow-up appointment in three months.",
