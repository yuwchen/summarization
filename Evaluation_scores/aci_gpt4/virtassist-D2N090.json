He reports that he was not monitoring his blood sugar readings over the weekend and felt woozy. His wife took him to the ER, where his blood sugar was found to be high. He was not admitted to the hospital and felt better after returning home. He attributes his poor dietary choices to his mother's hospitalization for a hip replacement. He has been following his diet more closely since then. He denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or dizziness. He has been managing his depression with meditation and does not want to start medication or therapy. He has been compliant with his immunosuppression medications for his kidney transplant and has regular follow-ups with his nephrologist.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n Vital signs are within normal limits. He does not appear in any distress. No carotid bruits are appreciated. Heart exam reveals a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, which is unchanged from previous visits. Lungs are clear to auscultation. He has 1+ edema in his lower extremities.  \nRESULTS\n Blood glucose is 162 mg/dL. Hemoglobin A1c is 8%. Kidney function is stable.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n  - Hyperglycemia Increase lantus to 20 units at night. Monitor blood sugar and report any changes. Order hemoglobin A1c in two months. - Depression Continue meditation and avoid medication or therapy at this time.

He has his moments, but as long as he finds some time to relax in the afternoon and then it seems to work out.
