He reports that this is the first time he has injured this knee.    \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n The patient's blood pressure is 125/80. On a neck exam, there is no lymphadenopathy. On a heart exam, the patient's heart is regular. On a lung exam, lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There is edema, some ecchymosis, and an effusion present on the right knee. The patient has decreased range of motion, pain when pressure is applied to the right medial knee, and decreased varus and valgus tests. The patient reports pain when their knee is bent.   \nRESULTS\n An x-ray of the right knee is ordered to ensure that no bones are broken. An a lipid panel is also ordered.   \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The patient is assessed to have a medial collateral ligament strain. Physical therapy is recommended to strengthen the muscles around the knee. Meloxicam 15mg is prescribed once daily to take down swelling and assist with pain.
