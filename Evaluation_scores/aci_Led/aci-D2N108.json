RESULTS An x-ray of the rightfoot was obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN The patient presents today with a 2-month history of non-healed right foot Ulcer. He has a history of diabetes. I believe his diabetes is a major cause of his not being able to heal. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control. He explained that he takes medication but does not monitor his sugar. I advised him that his blood sugar should be checked regularly. He was provided with a surgical shoe to be worn while this is happening. I recommended that we obtain an abi ankle brachial index to determine the blood supply in his foot to see if the ulcer can actually heal. I have also performed a debridement and cremation of the dead tissue. I prescribed clindamycin 500 mg to take twice daily for 7 days to try to rid of the infection. Additionally, I have prescribed him a shoe to wear for the next month to help with the pain and swelling. The Patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress.
