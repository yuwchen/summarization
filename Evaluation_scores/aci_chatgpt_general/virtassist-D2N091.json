    "Jerry is a 54-year-old male with osteoporosis and multiple sclerosis. He presents for an annual exam and mentions experiencing lack of sleep, which has been affecting him. He has tried various strategies for insomnia but nothing seems to help. Jerry does not report any issues with his joints or recent broken bones related to his osteoporosis. He last saw the neurologist six months ago for his multiple sclerosis and is currently taking the medication without any issues. He mentions a lingering issue with his knee surgery causing weakness in his right leg, but otherwise, he feels fine. The doctor does a physical exam and finds that Jerry's vital signs are good, his lungs are clear, and his heart sounds good. Jerry has weakness in his lower extremities, particularly in the right leg, and shows arthritic changes in his right knee. The doctor orders a refill of Fosamax for osteoporosis and advises Jerry to continue seeing the neurologist and taking the medication for multiple sclerosis. The doctor finalizes the note and asks Jerry if he has any questions, to which Jerry replies that he does not.",
