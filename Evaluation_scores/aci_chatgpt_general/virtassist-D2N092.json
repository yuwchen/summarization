    "Summary: \n\nThe patient, Mrs. Martinez, visits Dr. Gomez with complaints of pain in her arm near her wrist. She explains to the doctor that the pain occurred while playing tennis and hitting a backhand shot, causing her arm to jar. The doctor asks if there was any swelling or numbness, to which Mrs. Martinez responds that there was minimal swelling and no numbness. The doctor then inquires about her medical history and she mentions having allergies and taking Flonase. She also mentions a past trauma of falling onto a rake while doing lawn work. The doctor examines her arm and finds tenderness when pressing and bending the arm, especially around the thumb. Based on the examination and x-ray, the doctor concludes that there is no fracture but suspects a strain and contusion in the muscle. The doctor recommends conservative treatment with ice and anti-inflammatory medication (Motrin, 800mg three times a day with food). If the symptoms do not improve within a week, the patient is instructed to follow up. The doctor orders the necessary procedures and medications, and the patient expresses her gratitude.",
