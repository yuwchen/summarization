    "Summary:\nKayla Ward, a 7th grade student, is at the doctor's office for a new visit with her mother regarding her acne, which started two years ago. She has been using Persa-Gel and washing regularly, which has been somewhat helpful. There are no associated symptoms such as itching, bleeding, or pain. Kayla lives with her parents, sister, and pets (a dog, bird, and bunnies). She also participates in sports. Dr. Price asks about the acne on her chest and back, to which Kayla responds that it's not too bad and that she has used over-the-counter washes and Persa-Gel. Kayla's current skincare routine involves wiping her face down in the morning and using the ELF Super Clarity cleanser, toner, and Persa-Gel at night. She sometimes uses the cleanser in the morning if needed. Kayla describes today as a good day for her skin. She does not experience acne flare-ups with her periods and has been getting regular periods for about two years. The biggest flare-up occurred when she started school sports. Mrs. Ward, Kayla's mother, mentions that Kayla has been diligent with her skincare regimen, but it hasn't helped as much as they hoped. Dr. Price performs a full examination and diagnoses Kayla with mild to moderate acne, primarily comodonal with a small inflammatory component. He recommends starting with topical therapy, including washing her face with a mild cleanser in the morning, using a noncomedogenic moisturizer with SPF 30, and applying adapalene, 0.1% cream, in the evening. He advises starting with a few nights a week and gradually increasing to nightly use. If the prescribed medication is expensive or not covered by insurance, over-the-counter alternatives can be tried. Dr. Price also mentions that Kayla has multiple benign moles, which appear normal and do not raise concerns. The next follow-up is scheduled in six months. Kayla agrees to the treatment plan and thanks the doctor. The doctor instructs her to reach out if she has any questions or concerns before the next visit.",
