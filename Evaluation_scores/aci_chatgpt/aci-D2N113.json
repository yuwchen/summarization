    " clinical note   \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n  The patient came into the clinic anxious after having been informed that she tested positive for Hepatitis C. She had no prior knowledge of this condition and had a previous history of IV drug use and alcohol abuse that she had since quit, as well as smoking. She also mentioned feeling tired at the end of the day.   \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n  The patient's vitals were all within the normal range. She was in no distress and had no jaundice. Upon examination, her heart was regular with a two out of six systolic murmur, but her lungs, abdomen and musculoskeletal system were all normal.   \nRESULTS\n  Based on her initial blood work, the patient tested positive for Hepatitis C with an elevated AST at 39. However, her ALT albumin and total bilirubin levels were normal.   \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n  Additional blood work, including a hep C RNA and HCV genotype will be conducted to confirm the diagnosis. An ultrasound will also be performed to determine the severity of her liver disease. The patient should also arrange to have her family screened for the virus. Once all of the results are collected, a treatment plan will be developed based on the severity of the condition. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in three weeks.",
