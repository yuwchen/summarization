    "The patient, Julie, is seeing the doctor about her frequent and severe headaches. Julie has been struggling with headaches for years, initially associated with her menstrual cycle and stress. However, recently her headaches have been more frequent and severe. The headaches are mostly on the right side, behind her eye, and have a pulsating sensation. Julie has noticed that exercise, specifically jogging, triggers worse headaches. She has also been experiencing ringing in her ears and occasional blurred vision on the side of her vision. Julie does not have any numbness or tingling in her hands, feet, or face. \n\nDuring the physical examination, the doctor finds papilledema, swelling behind the eye, and conducts a neurological exam with normal results. The doctor suspects idiopathic intracranial hypertension, characterized by increased pressure in the brain without a known cause. Further tests, such as an MRI to check for other conditions and a spinal tap to evaluate and potentially decrease the pressure, are recommended. The doctor also suggests a complete eye exam by a neuro-ophthalmologist. Medications can be used to decrease the pressure in the brain and alleviate symptoms, and lifestyle changes, including exercise and weight loss, are important for treatment.\n\nThe doctor will work on getting insurance preapproval for the MRI and schedule the necessary tests and appointments. No surgery is mentioned as an immediate requirement.",
