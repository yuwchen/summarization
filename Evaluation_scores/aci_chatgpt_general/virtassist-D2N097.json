    "The patient, Elizabeth, is a 66-year-old female with a history of depression and hypertension. She presents for her annual exam. Elizabeth has been going to therapy once a week and has a good support system at home. Her blood pressure has been normal and she has been taking the prescribed medication for hypertension. During the physical exam, a slight 2/6 systolic ejection murmur and trace lower extremity edema are noted. The EKG results are normal. The doctor determines that Elizabeth is managing her depression well and does not need medication at this time. The plan is to continue the current medication for hypertension, monitor blood pressure, schedule a mammogram, and take all medications at the same time.",

She reports that she is starting to go in person rather than virtual, which has helped even more. The patient has a good support system at home with her husband and her children live down the street.\n\nThe patient reports that her blood pressure has been doing well. She has been using the blood pressure cuff once a day and her readings seem normal. She has continued to utilize Lisinopril 20 mg daily, as prescribed.\n\nThe patient endorses nasal congestion.
