    "The patient, Brandon, is experiencing neck pain and explains that it is due to multiple car crashes, with the most recent one happening in February. Brandon has previously undergone therapy and surgery for neck pain related to previous car crashes. He rates his pain as a twelve out of ten and mentions that he was prescribed fentanyl for pain relief, but has not received a prescription for several weeks. Brandon also experiences stiffness, sharp incapacitating pain, headaches, dizziness, numbness in the left arm and right leg, and spasms. The doctor performs a physical exam and notes tenderness in the neck area and limited range of movement. The doctor rules out a fracture based on previous imaging results and diagnoses Brandon with a neck sprain. The doctor recommends conservative treatment, such as applying ice, performing exercises, and prescribing robaxin for muscle relaxation. They also discuss the possibility of local injections and referral to pain medication. The doctor advises Brandon to stay off work until the results of an MRI are available.",
