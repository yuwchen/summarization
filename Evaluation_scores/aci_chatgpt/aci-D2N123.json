    " \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n  Tyler is a 56-year-old male who presents with a complaint of difficulty swallowing over the past four to five weeks. He reports feeling like something is stuck in his throat and a little painful, though not associated with coughing, and only affecting him with solids, not liquids. No blood, vomiting or weight loss reported.   \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n  Normal neck and thyroid with no masses, no lymph nodes. Exam of the throat appears normal with no masses or redness, though there is some epigastric tenderness. Lung exam is clear, and heart exam is normal, with no murmurs. Belly exam reveals tenderness at the epigastric region, though no masses are palpable. Neurological exam is unremarkable.   \nRESULTS\n  A referral for gastroenterology is recommended due to the concern of esophageal stricture. Prilosec is also recommended as reflux can exacerbate this issue. Norvasc is continued for high blood pressure.   \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n  Repeat hemoglobin A1c is ordered, and blood work is ordered to check kidney function. An eye referral for ophthalmology is given for checking the eyes for diabetic retinopathy. Metformin is continued, with no changes recommended at this time. Tyler is to return in one month for follow-up, and a refill for Norvasc will be sent to the pharmacy.",

He states that he has never fully choked before, but has recently thought about potentially choking. He denies having to cough. Denies having this issue with liquids, hot or cold. Denies hematochezia, vomiting blood, coughing up blood, any weight changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, the patient states he is doing well.
