    "Patient: Kelly Wood, born February 15th, 1979. Presented with hematuria and came for a renal ultrasound. Urine dipstick results were negative for leukocytes, nitrates, protein, ketones, bilirubin, and glucose. Urine color is yellow and clear, urobilinogen 0.2, pH 5.5, specific gravity 1.020, and there is a trace amount of blood in the urine. Renal ultrasound findings show a 10 cm x 5 cm right kidney with no stones, masses, or hydronephrosis. Left kidney measures 10.8 cm x 5 cm with a non-obstructing 6 mm renal stone. Pre-void urine volume is 533 mL and post-void is 0 mL. \n\nDoctor: Informs Mrs. Wood about the ultrasound findings, confirming the presence of one non-obstructing kidney stone in the left kidney. Mrs. Wood shares her previous experience of passing two small stones and having episodes of bright red urine and pain while urinating. Pain level at the time was an eight out of ten.\n\nPatient: Reports that pain and discomfort have improved after passing the stones.\n\nDoctor: Notes that Mrs. Wood is currently taking alavert 10 mg and has no drug allergies.\n\nDoctor: Discusses the cause of kidney stones, mentioning factors such as dehydration, family history, certain foods, digestive tract disease, and certain medical conditions.\n\nPatient: Admits to not drinking enough water and consuming sugary drinks like Mountain Dew.\n\nDoctor: Advises Mrs. Wood to drink about half of her body weight in ounces of water per day and avoid sugary drinks.
