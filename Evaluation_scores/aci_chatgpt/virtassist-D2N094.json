    "\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n The patient is a 42-year-old female who reports right index finger pain after falling while skiing on a double black diamond slope. She reports having pain in the finger for approximately five days, rating it seven out of 10, and has taken ibuprofen without relief. She has not iced the finger or used a splint.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n Upon examination, it was discovered that the patient has a sprain of her distal interphalangeal joint of her right index finger, which is commonly referred to as the dip joint. There were no visible fractures or dislocations detected. The patient reported pain when pressure was applied or when the joint was pulled.  \nRESULTS\n The patient's right hand x-ray came back normal. After completing the examination, the doctor prescribed 15mg of Mobic, an anti-inflammatory drug, once a day for two weeks, and she was advised to use a splint on her right finger to help with the pain.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The doctor diagnosed the patient with a sprain of her distal interphalangeal joint of her right index finger and treated her by prescribing anti-inflammatory medication and recommending splint usage. The patient was advised to return in two weeks for a follow-up exam to ensure that the finger is healing properly. If necessary, additional hand therapy could be discussed at that time.",
