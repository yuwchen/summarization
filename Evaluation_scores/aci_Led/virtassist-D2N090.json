He denies he was admitted to the hospital. He explains that he was not following his diet very closely and felt woozy. His mother was in the hospital the last week for a hip replacement.

He last saw Dr. Reyes about 3 weeks ago, and everything seemed to be fine. His kidney function is good. In terms of his depression, he has been pretty diligent with his medication and following doctor's orders. He has had his moments, but he states that as he finds some time to relax, at least in the afternoon, it seems to work out. Regarding his diabetes, he is doing well. He is taking immunotherapy meds and has been diligent about it. He states that he has not eaten before he came in here and did not eat before that day. His hemoglobin A1c is 8. This is a little high.
