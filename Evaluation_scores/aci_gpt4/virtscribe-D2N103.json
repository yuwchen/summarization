    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Ms. Sanchez is a 58-year-old female with a history of mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation, diabetes, asthma, and recurrent chest discomfort with negative cardiac workup for coronary artery disease. She underwent mitral valve repair on 8/3/2020 and has been doing well from a cardiac standpoint since then. She reports occasional episodes of chest pain and dyspnea on exertion, which resolve with rest and do not interfere with her daily activities. She denies any new symptoms or complications.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n On examination, she is alert and oriented, with normal vital signs. Head and neck exam reveals no jugular venous distension. Chest exam reveals reduced breath sounds, but clear to auscultation and percussion. Cardiac exam reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm, with an accentuated S1 and no S3. Abdominal exam is benign. Extremities show trace peripheral edema.  \nRESULTS\n ECG taken on 12/26/2020 shows atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response and T-wave inversion anteriorly, with no significant changes from the previous study.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n Ms. Sanchez is recovering well from her mitral valve repair and has no signs of heart failure or valve dysfunction. Her atrial fibrillation is well controlled with coumadin, lasix, and atenolol. She is advised to continue with her current medications and to monitor her symptoms and activity level. She is scheduled for a follow-up visit in six to nine months. She has no further questions or concerns.",
