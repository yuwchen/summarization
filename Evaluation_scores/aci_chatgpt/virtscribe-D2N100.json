    "\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n Patient Kayla Ward, 7th grade student, presents with a two-year history of acne on the face. She has been using over-the-counter Persa-gel and washing regularly, with some improvement in symptoms. There are no associated symptoms, such as itching, bleeding, or pain.   \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n Kayla underwent a full exam except for under the underwear and bra. Multiple benign nevi are noted on the trunk and extremities. There are scattered skin-colored papules, open and closed comedones, and erythmateous papules on the face, primarily on the forehead, central cheeks, and chin. The chest and back are relatively spared. The remainder of the examination is normal.  \nRESULTS\n Mild to moderate acne is diagnosed, mostly comedonal with a small inflammatory component. Multiple benign moles are noted, with no worrisome features.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n Kayla is prescribed a topical therapy starting with a mild cleanser in the morning followed by a moisturizer labeled \"noncomedogenic\" with sunscreen SPF 30 or higher. In the evening, she is instructed to wash her face with the same cleanser and apply adapalene 0.1% cream to the areas that generally have acne. Clean and clear Persa-gel can be applied in a thin layer, followed by a noncomedogenic moisturizer. Kayla is advised that her atopic retinoid may cause sensitivity and dryness, so she needs to wear sunscreen when outside. A follow-up visit is scheduled in six months.",

Kayla reports that today is a good day for her acne. She denies any significant acne present on the chest or back. There are no associated symptoms, including no itching, bleeding, or pain.\n\nThe patient has been washing her face regularly. Her acne regimen includes washing her face in the morning with Persa-Gel and at night e.l.f. SuperClarify Cleanser along with toner and Persa-Gel. This regimen is somewhat helpful. She wears sunscreen in the summer SPF 30.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nLives with parents and sister. They have a dog, bird, and rabbits in the home. She is in the 7th grade and active in basketball, volleyball, and tap dancing.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNo significant family medical history.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nIntegumentary\nFull exam is performed today except for under the underwear and under the bra. There are multiple benign nevi on the trunk and extremities. Scattered skin-colored papules, open and closed comedones, and erythematous papules on the face, primarily on the forehead, with also some on the central cheeks and chin. The chest and back are relatively spared. The remainder of examination is normal.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Comedonal acne.\n\u2022 Multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.\n\nKayla Ward is a 15-year-old female seen today for new acne evaluation. Full skin examination revealed mild to moderate comedonal acne with a small inflammatory component and multiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.\n\nPLAN\n\nComedonal acne.\nWe discussed the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment options. I recommend starting with topical therapy first. The patient was instructed to wash face every morning with a mild cleanser, then use a non-comedogenic moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 of higher. In the evening, wash face with same mild cleanser and allow to dry. Apply a thin layer of topical retinoid, Retin-A 0.1% gel, to acne prone areas. Start off using a few nights a week, slowly work up to using every night. If it is very expensive or not covered by insurance, you can try Differin gel over the counter. Your topical retinoid will cause sun sensitivity, so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside. It may also cause some dryness or irritation.\n\nMultiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.\nReassurance given moles are normal in appearance and have no concerning characteristics. Will continue to monitor for progression or changes in 6 months.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow recommended cleaning regimen.\nStart Retin-A 0.1% topical gel, apply to acne prone areas, titrate as instructed.\nFollow up in 6 months.\n",
