    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 40-year-old male who presents with chronic low back pain and left leg pain that started about a month ago. He has a history of a fall from a roof 30 years ago that caused a possible vertebral fracture. He reports that his pain is worse with standing, walking, coughing, and sneezing, and better with lying down. He describes his pain as an electrical toothache that radiates from his lower back to his hip, calf, and big toe. He rates his pain as 6/10 at rest and 13/10 at worst. He has not taken any medications today. He has tried NSAIDs and physical therapy in the past without relief. He has no numbness, tingling, or weakness in his lower extremities. He is interested in a nerve ablation procedure that he heard from a friend.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n Vital signs are within normal limits. Back exam reveals no bony deformities, erythema, or ecchymosis. He has tenderness to palpation at the L4 vertebrae. He has pain with flexion and extension of his back. He has 4/5 strength in his left lower extremity and 5/5 in his right lower extremity. Reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory are intact in both lower extremities.  \nRESULTS\n MRI of the lumbar spine shows a disk herniation at the L4-L5 level with nerve root impingement.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The patient has acute disk herniation at L4-L5 with nerve root impingement causing low back pain and left leg pain. The plan is to perform an epidural steroid injection today to reduce the inflammation and pain. He will be referred back to physical therapy to strengthen his core and back muscles. He will follow up with me in one month to evaluate his response to the injection. He is agreeable to this plan. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the injection have been explained to him and he has given informed consent. The nurse will prepare him for the procedure.",

    "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMatthew Hill is a pleasant 44-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of back pain. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 30 years ago, when he fell off of a roof. He endorses that it was very bothersome and he was unable to play football. He states that he was told that he may have a fracture at that time. The patient reports that his pain has worsened 1 month ago. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates into his left hip, down his left leg, on the side of his calf, and into his left big toe. The patient describes his pain as an \"electrical tooth ache\" that radiates down his entire left leg. He notes that he has to use a cane to walk as his left foot drags when he walks. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 8 out of 10, however it can get to a 13 out of 10 at its worst. He states that he did not take any medication before his appointment so it did not affect his pain during our visit. The patient notes that he was in the waiting room for 30 minutes today and states that it made his symptoms worse. His pain is aggravated by standing, ambulating, coughing, and sneezing. The patient states that he is unable to tie his shoes secondary to the pain. The patient states that his pain is alleviated by lying down. He also reports weakness in his bilateral legs and his back. The patient denies any numbness or tingling. The patient has attempted NSAIDs in the past without relief. He has also attended physical therapy.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL: Vitals look good.\nMSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No bony abnormalities. No redness. No bruising present. Pain with palpation at the L4 vertebrae. Positive for pain with flexion and extension of the back. 4/5 strength on the left, 5/5 strength on the right. Reflexes are brisk. Motor and sensory are intact throughout the bilateral lower extremities.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed today. It revealed a disc herniation at the level of the L4-5 vertebrae. It is associated with some nerve root impingement.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nAcute disc herniation at L4-5 with nerve root impingement.\n\nPLAN\n\nI have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with a epidural steroid injection and formal physical therapy. With the patient's consent, we will proceed with a epidural steroid injection into the lumbar spine today. He will follow up with me in 4 weeks to check on his progress.",
