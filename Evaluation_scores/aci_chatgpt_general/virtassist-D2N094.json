    "Summary:\nMs. James, a 42-year-old female, visits Dr. Cooper for a finger injury sustained while skiing. The injury occurred five days ago and she has been experiencing pain rated at a seven out of ten. She has taken ibuprofen but it did not provide relief. She has not used ice or a splint for the finger. Apart from the finger injury, she has chronic constipation managed with Miralax. She previously had an appendectomy. An x-ray shows no fractures, but the physical examination indicates a sprain of the distal interphalangeal joint of the right index finger. Dr. Cooper recommends a splint and prescribes the anti-inflammatory drug Mobic. Ms. James is instructed to return for a follow-up appointment in two weeks.",
