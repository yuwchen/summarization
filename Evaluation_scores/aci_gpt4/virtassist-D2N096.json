    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Mrs. Anderson, a 44-year-old female, presented with left shoulder pain for one week, which started after a gymnastics class. She took tylenol for two or three days, but it did not help. She denied any trauma, fever, or other symptoms. She had a past surgery on her left arm, but it was not related to her pain.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n On examination, she had tenderness and limited range of motion in her left shoulder, especially in abduction and internal rotation. There was no swelling, deformity, or crepitus. The rest of the musculoskeletal exam was normal.  \nRESULTS\n The x-ray of the left shoulder showed no fracture or dislocation. The joint space and the soft tissues were normal.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The diagnosis was left shoulder sprain, likely involving the rotator cuff or the acromioclavicular joint. The plan was to prescribe ibuprofen 600 mg three times a day for a week, and to advise her to use ice or heat pad as needed, and to rest her left arm. She was instructed to avoid lifting heavy weights or doing strenuous activities with her left shoulder for three to four weeks. She was scheduled to follow up in three weeks, or sooner if the pain persisted or worsened. She was also given the option of trying advil or aleve if ibuprofen was not effective. She was educated about the possible complications of shoulder sprain, such as chronic pain, stiffness, or instability. She expressed understanding and agreement with the plan.",
