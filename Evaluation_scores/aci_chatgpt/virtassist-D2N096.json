    "\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n Mrs. Anderson, a 44-year-old female, presented with a complaint of a left shoulder pain for a week. She had taken Tylenol, which did not help. The pain started in her gymnastics class while performing a certain move.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n The doctor examined the patient and asked her to move her shoulder. Any kind of movement on her left shoulder caused pain. The doctor requested a look at her x-ray which showed that there was no fracture. He observed that the injury was in the joint.  \nRESULTS\n No fracture was detected on the patient's x-ray.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The doctor prescribed the patient with ibuprofen of 600 milligrams to be taken thrice daily for one week. He suggested that if there was still pain after a week, the patient could use an ice or heat pad to relieve the pain. The doctor advised that the patient should rest and not use her left arm for heavy lifting. He also told her that in case the pain persisted after three weeks, she could come back for further evaluation. Finally, the doctor advised the patient to try Aleve, an alternative to Ibuprofen, for pain relief.",
