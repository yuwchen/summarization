    "\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n The patient is a 45-year-old male who injured his ankle while playing basketball with his son. The patient reports landing awkwardly after being hit by his son while going for a lap. The patient reports having difficulty walking and a feeling of instability in the ankle. Upon examination, the doctor found tenderness laterally and over the medial deltoid region, swelling on the lateral side of the ankle, brisk capillary refill, and no horrible malalignment. An x-ray showed a displaced lateral malleolus at the Weber C level with no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures but noted that the fracture was unstable.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n The doctor performed a physical exam of the ankle with exquisite tenderness laterally and over the medial deltoid region, swelling on the lateral side of the ankle, brisk capillary refill, and no horrible malalignment.  \nRESULTS\n The x-ray showed a displaced lateral malleolus at the Weber C level with no evidence of medial or posterior malleolar fractures.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The patient was diagnosed with a lateral malleolar fracture and will require surgery. The doctor recommended putting some plate and some screws in the ankle to stabilize it. The patient will need to be out of commission for about three months, but he can still coach, and they will provide him with crutches to assist in mobility. The doctor prescribed meloxicam to reduce swelling and instructed the patient to keep the ankle elevated and iced. The patient works from home, so he can elevate his ankle regularly. The patient was informed that he should not perform any strenuous physical activity until cleared by the doctor.",
