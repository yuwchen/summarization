    "In this patient-doctor dialogue, the doctor is seeing Melissa Sanchez for a follow-up after her mitral valve repair. The doctor notes that at her previous appointment, she was doing well from a cardiac standpoint and recommended she continue with the same medication. However, an ECG taken on 12/26/2020 reveals atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response and t-wave inversion anteriorly. The patient also has a history of mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, asthma, and recurrent chest discomfort with negative cardiac workup for coronary artery disease. \n\nDuring the appointment, the doctor asks about any new symptoms and the patient reports occasional chest pains and shallow breathing. The symptoms last for a few minutes and then disappear for a couple of weeks. The patient is taking her medications regularly, including coumadin, lasix, and atenolol. She mentions that the atenolol initially made her irritable but she has gotten used to it. \n\nThe doctor performs a physical exam and notes no JVD or abnormal breath sounds in the head and neck and lungs. The patient's heart rhythm is irregularly irregular due to atrial fibrillation. The doctor also checks the patient's belly and extremities, finding no pain or peripheral edema. \n\nBased on the exam and ECG, the doctor determines that the patient's heart valves are working well and she is recovering nicely from the surgery. The atrial fibrillation is well controlled with medication. The doctor recommends continuing with the current medication regimen and encourages the patient to stay active. \n\nThe doctor schedules a follow-up appointment in about six to nine months, as there are no immediate concerns from a cardiac perspective. The patient thanks the doctor and the appointment concludes.",
