    "The patient, Betty, is experiencing frequent asthma symptoms including coughing and wheezing. She has noticed that her symptoms are triggered by getting sick with a cold and being around her aunt's cat. She has been having breathing problems almost every month for the past six months and has had to visit urgent care and the emergency department multiple times. She currently uses a blue inhaler called ventolin for relief, needing to use it almost every day and sometimes waking up at night to use it as well. She has never been hospitalized for asthma except when she was eight years old. During her urgent care and ER visits, she has been prescribed prednisone multiple times. Betty does not smoke or use any tobacco or vaping products. She is occasionally exposed to secondhand smoke in bars, which irritates her symptoms. The doctor performs a physical exam and listens to Betty's heart and lungs, finding diminished lung sounds with occasional wheezing. The doctor diagnoses Betty with moderate intermittent asthma based on her symptoms and the results of her pulmonary function test. The doctor prescribes Flovent inhaler twice a day as an inhaled steroid to reduce daily symptoms and the need for the rescue inhaler. The doctor also plans to create an asthma action plan for Betty and schedules a follow-up appointment in one month.",

She can continue using her Ventolin inhaler 2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours as needed. I have recommended using her albuterol inhaler 1 to 2 puffs and then monitor her breathing prior to taking an additional 1 to 2 puffs.
