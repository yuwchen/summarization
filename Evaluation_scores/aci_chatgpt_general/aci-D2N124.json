    "Summary:\nJerry, a 45-year-old male, visited the doctor with an ankle injury. He explains that he hurt his ankle while playing basketball with his son. The ankle is bruised and swollen, and Jerry is experiencing difficulty walking and instability. He mentions that he recently got back into working out and does not want to disrupt his routine. The doctor examines Jerry's ankle and finds exquisite tenderness on the lateral side and some tenderness over the medial deltoid region. An x-ray reveals a displaced lateral malleolus fracture, which is causing the instability. The doctor recommends surgery to repair the fracture and informs Jerry that he will need to rest for about three months. However, he can still coach starting in April. The doctor prescribes meloxicam for swelling and advises Jerry to ice the ankle and elevate it regularly.",

He enjoys working out and reports he recently resumed engaging in a consistent gym routine.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right ankle pain and instability.\nSkin: Reports right ankle bruising and swelling.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Brisk capillary refill.\nSKIN: No epidermolysis. Intact.\nMSK: Examination of the right ankle: Exquisite tenderness laterally. Mild tenderness over the medial deltoid region. Swelling on the lateral side of the ankle. No horrible malalignment.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays, including AP, lateral, and oblique views of the right ankle, were obtained in the office and reviewed today.
