The onset of his symptoms began 2 years ago. He has noticed that his breathing is not what it used to be. He describes an increased need to catch his breath. The patient also reports he gets \u201cmid-shortness of breath\u201d without reason. He has been seen at an urgent care where he received a nebulizer treatment and was prescribed an inhaler, which he uses when his symptoms are present. The patient states his symptoms are aggravated by living with a cat in his house and are present even when the cat is not around or is outside. He has experienced epiphora with rheum present that he attributes to allergies. He has had diarrhea after consuming large amounts of alcohol. He denies any symptoms at this time including shortness of breath, rash, nausea, vomiting, and lip or throat swelling. The patient denies any previous issues with allergies.\n\nHe enjoys hunting.\n\nVITALS\n\nOxygen Saturation: Normal on room air.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL: In no apparent distress.\nHEAD: No angioedema.\nRESPIRATORY: No audible stridor. I do appreciate some faint expiratory wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields.\nSKIN: No rash.\n\nRESULTS\n\nA chest x-ray, obtained and reviewed today is normal.\nPulmonary function test, obtained and reviewed today is normal.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nNewly diagnosed allergic asthma.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination, radiographic findings, and pulmonary function test results today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. He will continue to use the albuterol inhaler; however, he should limit its use to when he is experiencing a severe flare-up of symptoms. I advised he should take it as soon as he starts to feel any symptoms at all. I have also prescribed the patient Singulair 10 mg to be taken once daily. This should help to decrease the occurrences of his asthma. I have also recommended we proceed with an allergy skin test to target what his triggers are in the hope that we can avoid any other management. If we unable to determine his allergens, then we may consider further testing or immunotherapy.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 1 week for skin testing.",
