    "Summary:\nThe patient, named Bobby, visits the doctor with complaints of persistent shoulder pain on his right side. He attributes the pain to previous injuries from playing baseball and recent work in his backyard. The pain is located on the outside of his shoulder and is more noticeable when he raises his arm. He experiences pain only when he moves his arm and also at night due to sleeping on that side. The patient has been taking Advil and icing the area for relief. The doctor evaluates the patient's vital signs and performs a physical exam, finding limited range of motion and tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus. X-ray results show no fractures. The doctor diagnoses rotator cuff tendinopathy and prescribes an MRI to rule out any other issues. The patient is referred to physical therapy for 6-8 weeks, and if symptoms do not improve, a steroid injection is considered. The doctor also addresses the patient's foot soreness and recommends soaking in Epsom salts for relief. The patient agrees with the plan and expresses hope for improvement.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight shoulder pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBobby Flores is a 56-year-old male, right-hand-dominant, male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right shoulder pain.\n\nThe onset of his pain began a few weeks ago, when he was performing different projects in his backyard. He states that he was sore all over the next couple of days. He locates his pain to the lateral aspect of his right shoulder. His pain is aggravated with movement. The patient denies any restriction with his arm. He also reports pain at night when he sleeps on his right side. The patient denies any numbness in his arm or hands. He has been taking Advil and icing his shoulder, which provides some relief. The patient reports a history of right shoulder pain when he was younger while playing baseball.\n\nThe patient also has complaints of bilateral foot and ankle pain. He attributes this pain to the yard work he has been doing. For treatment, he has iced and elevated them, which provided some relief.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Positive for right shoulder pain.\nNeurological: Negative for numbness in hands.\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature: 97.8 degrees F.\nHeart Rate: 62 BPM.\nRespirations:16.\nBlood pressure: 116/84 mm Hg.\nOxygen saturation: 99 percent on room air.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: >Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds.\nNEURO: Normal sensation. Neurovascularly intact on the right. Sensation to touch is intact on the right shoulder.\nMSK: Examination of the right shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness at the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or AC joints. Good hand grip.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right shoulder were taken. These reveal no fracture or dislocation. No abnormalities noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Right shoulder rotator cuff tendinopathy.\n2. Bilateral foot pain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right shoulder to evaluate for a possible rotator cuff tear. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy for 6 to 8 weeks. He can continue taking Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend a cortisone injection.\n\nIn regards to his bilateral feet pain, I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I am recommending the patient soak his feet in an Epsom salt soak as well as elevate as needed.\n",
