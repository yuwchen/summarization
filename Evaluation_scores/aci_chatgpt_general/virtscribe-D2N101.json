She has been to a chiropractor for her back pain and takes migraine medication.\n\nDoctor: Dr. Gonzalez, a plastic surgeon specializing in breast reduction surgeries. She performs the procedure frequently. She explains the process of breast reduction, which involves removing tissue from the breasts, lifting them, and elevating the nipple position. She discusses the surgery duration, the need for drains, and the clear plastic tape over the incisions to minimize scarring. The doctor mentions that breastfeeding may be affected after the surgery and that the breasts may change in size and appearance over time. She explains the potential for slight alterations in nipple sensation and post-surgery bruising. The doctor mentions that most patients experience relief from back and neck pain after the procedure.\n\nMedical information: Symptomatic macromastia, bilateral breast ptosis, no nipple retraction or discharge, no breast tenderness or masses, no axillary lymphadenopathy.
