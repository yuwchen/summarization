    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with right knee pain after a water skiing accident five days ago. He reports twisting his knee when he landed a jump and experiencing swelling and pain afterwards. He denies hearing or feeling any pop at the time of injury. He has been taking over-the-counter aleve twice a day and applying cold packs to the knee. He has no history of prior knee injuries. He has a history of hypertension controlled with lisinopril.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n Vital signs are stable with blood pressure of 120/77 mmHg. Neck exam is unremarkable. Heart exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs. Lung exam reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally. Musculoskeletal exam reveals ecchymosis, edema, and effusion of the right knee with pain to palpation of the medial aspect. There is decreased range of motion and a negative varus, valgus, and lachman test. There is no evidence of neurovascular compromise with palpable distal pulses and no lower extremity edema.  \nRESULTS\n Pending x-ray of right knee and lipid panel.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n   - Right knee pain Likely medial collateral ligament strain. Will order x-ray to rule out fracture and refer to physical therapy for rehabilitation. Will prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once a day for anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect. Will advise to rest the knee and avoid water skiing until further evaluation. - Hypertension Well controlled with lisinopril 20 mg daily. Will continue current regimen and monitor blood pressure at home. Will order lipid panel to screen for dyslipidemia. - Health maintenance Due for tetanus booster. Will administer today.",
