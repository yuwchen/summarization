HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Betty Ross is a pleasant 53-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of asthma. The onset of her asthma began approximately 8 years ago, when she was around 8 years old. She states that she feels she can never catch a break with her symptoms. She notes that her symptoms tend to flare when she is sick or goes to her aunt's house. In the past 6 months, she has been going to urgent care, where they have prescribed antibiotics and occasionally steroids. She has also been taking her inhaled steroid as prescribed. In terms of her daily symptoms, the patient reports that she is coughing and wheezing. She also notes that she wakes up a couple of times a week needing to use her inhaler. The patient states that when she tries to use it, it does not work. She explains that she has 2 inhalers, but she really just uses one of them as it is the only inhaler that helps her with the other one. She describes that almost everyday she feels like she is using her albuterol inhaler because she is always coughing and ventilating. She adds that a coupleof times a night she will wake up needing touse her inhalers. The Patient reports that her pulmonary function test that she did when she came into the office today is consistent with somebody who would be diagnosed with asthma. She denies any seasonal allergies. The patients has a history of hiking. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS \u2022 Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No ectopic beats. \u2022 Respiratory: Decreased lung sounds throughout with the occasional slight expiratory wheeze, bilaterally. \u2022 Neck: supple. Trachea is midline. No lymphadenopathy. \u2022 Musculoskeletal: No carotid bruit. Strong bilateral pulses. Brisk capillary refill. RESULTS Pulmonary function test, performed today. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN The patient's symptoms are consistent with moderate to intermediate intermittent asthma. It is important for her to be consistent with her inhaling steroid. She will be started on Flovent 100 10grams 1 puff twice per day to help her be symptom-free. We will also put together an asthma action plan for her that will help us look at her symptoms, see where her pain points can be, and we will work on how to handle those symptoms through that asthmaaction plan. INSTRUCTIONS The patient will follow up with me in 30 days to assess her progress.", "Asthma.
