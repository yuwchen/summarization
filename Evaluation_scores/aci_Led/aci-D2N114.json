HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Julie Mitchell is a pleasant 53-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of headaches. The onset of her headaches began when she was a teenager and they would be present around her menstrual periods. As she got older, she noticed that they were more frequent and severe. She states that they seem to get worse around her menstruation. The patient reports that she has been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight, but she does not exercise for very long as her headaches return. She also reports that as soon as she starts to jog, her headaches come back on. She denies any numbness or tingling to her hands or feet, or face. She endorses that she likes to run a lot and she is starting to get back into it. She has a recent MRI of the brain, which was reviewed in office today. This is her first visit to a neuro-ophthalmologist. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Musculoskeletal: Reports ringing in her ears. Neurological: Reports right-sided headaches. VITALS All vital signs are within normal limits. PHYSICAL EXAM CV: Normal sinus rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Eyes: Papilledema and swelling behind the right eye. MSK: Examination of the cranial nerves: All 12 nerves are intact including a normal cranial reflex. Gait: Normal gait. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 1. idiopathic intracranial hypertension. PLAN After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her MRI results will not necessarily support the diagnosis. I recommended that we obtain a spinal tap to evaluate the pressure in her brain, as this can lead to permanent changes in her vision. We also discussed that once we have that result, we will be able to schedule a MRI to check for any other conditions that could be contributing to her symptoms. Additionally, I advised her that we should schedule a complete eye exam for her to evaluate for any signs of permanent changes. All questions were answered.
