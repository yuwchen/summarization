ECG taken on 12/26/2020 reveals atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response and t-wave inversion anteriorly. Compared to the previous study, there are no significant changes. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Ms. Sanchez is a 62-year-old female who is being seen in office today for status following mitral valves repair on 08/03/2021. She was having a rough time prior to surgery, but she feels overall pretty good now. She is not having any new symptoms right now, however, she is still getting chest pains sometimes, and her breathing gets shallow. She states that if she feels like that, she will slow down a bit which helps, and then she will return to it later. She estimates that it usually lasts for a couple of weeks. She notes that she takes her medication regularly. The patient is taking coumadin 4 mg, Lasix 4 mg a day, and atenolol 50 mg every day. She denies any side effects from her current medications. Ms.anchez notes that the atenolarol is making her irritable in the beginning, but She has gotten used to it and it does not bother her as much now. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS \u2022 Cardiovascular: Endorses chest pain and shallow breathing. Endorses dyspnea on exertion. \u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorse peripheral edema on extremities. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION \u2022 Head and neck: No JVD detected. \u2022 Respiratory: Lungs have reduced breath. Auscultation and percussion are clear. \u2022 Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm. S1 slightly accentuated. No S3. No pain. \u2022 Gastrointestinal: No masses or tenderness. RESULTS Electrocardiogram taken earlier today reveals the atrial Fibrillation. It is well controlled with medicine. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN Ms. Hernandez is a 60-year -old female, female, born on 09/23/1972. She has a history of mitral regurgitation and atrialfibrillation, history of diabetes, asthma, and recurrent chest discomfort with a negative cardiac workup for coronary artery disease. PLAN After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her ecG taken today revealed atrialFibrillation but without any obvious signs of acute coronary syndrome. We discussed that this is not uncommon and that many people with a atrial-fib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes. I advised her to continue with her current medication regimen. She should continue to be active and I encouraged her to follow up in 6 to 9 months. All questions were answered.
