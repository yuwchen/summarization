    "In this dialogue, the patient (Charles) and the doctor discuss Charles' breathing difficulties. Charles mentions that he has been experiencing shortness of breath and catches his breath more often than before. The doctor asks about other symptoms and Charles mentions that his eyes water and he sometimes gets eyebugers, similar to his dog. The doctor suggests that it could be allergies and asks if Charles has noticed any rashes, nausea, or vomiting. Charles mentions that he has diarrhea after heavy drinking but no other symptoms. The doctor asks about any history of allergies and Charles says there is none. Charles mentions that he experiences symptoms in all three situations - at home, around the cat, and outside the house. The doctor performs a physical exam and finds faint expiratory wheezing in Charles' lung fields. The doctor reviews Charles' chest x-ray and pulmonary function test, both of which were normal. The doctor diagnoses Charles with newly diagnosed allergic asthma and prescribes an albuterol inhaler and Singulair to manage the asthma. The doctor also plans to proceed with allergy testing to identify potential triggers for Charles' symptoms. Charles asks if he should bring his cats to the appointment, and the doctor confirms that he should. The doctor schedules a follow-up appointment for next week to schedule the skin testing.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nShortness of breath.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nCharles Sullivan is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of shortness of breath. The onset of his symptoms began 2 years ago. He has noticed that his breathing is not what it used to be. He describes an increased need to catch his breath. The patient also reports he gets \u201cmid-shortness of breath\u201d without reason. He has been seen at an urgent care where he received a nebulizer treatment and was prescribed an inhaler, which he uses when his symptoms are present. The patient states his symptoms are aggravated by living with a cat in his house and are present even when the cat is not around or is outside. He has experienced epiphora with rheum present that he attributes to allergies. He has had diarrhea after consuming large amounts of alcohol. He denies any symptoms at this time including shortness of breath, rash, nausea, vomiting, and lip or throat swelling. The patient denies any previous issues with allergies.\n\nHe enjoys hunting.\n\nVITALS\n\nOxygen Saturation: Normal on room air.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL: In no apparent distress.\nHEAD: No angioedema.\nRESPIRATORY: No audible stridor. I do appreciate some faint expiratory wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields.\nSKIN: No rash.\n\nRESULTS\n\nA chest x-ray, obtained and reviewed today is normal.\nPulmonary function test, obtained and reviewed today is normal.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nNewly diagnosed allergic asthma.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination, radiographic findings, and pulmonary function test results today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. He will continue to use the albuterol inhaler; however, he should limit its use to when he is experiencing a severe flare-up of symptoms. I advised he should take it as soon as he starts to feel any symptoms at all. I have also prescribed the patient Singulair 10 mg to be taken once daily. This should help to decrease the occurrences of his asthma. I have also recommended we proceed with an allergy skin test to target what his triggers are in the hope that we can avoid any other management. If we unable to determine his allergens, then we may consider further testing or immunotherapy.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 1 week for skin testing.",
