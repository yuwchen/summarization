HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Ms. Edwards is a 54-year-old female who presents today for the evaluation of right-sided bilateral facial pain, as well as headaches. She reports that she has been experiencing stabbing shooting pain in her right face, especially in the right cheek bone area, where it sometimes gets super hot, for approximately 2 or 3 months. She notes that the pain initially just came on slowly and that she began noticing it as soon as she started noticing it. However, she notes that she now has episodes of shooting, stabbing, and excruciating pain in that same area. She states that sometimes the pain will happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it. The patient denies any sensory loss, numbness, or tingling in that part of her face. She also denies any weakness on the right side of the face, and she states that her smile seems equal on both sides. She denies any headaches, migraines, or other symptoms related to the pain. The patients have tried ibuprofen and Motrin, which have not been beneficial for her. She endorses that she really needs to see a neurosurgeon for her pain. PAST HISTORY Medical Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: None reported. SOCIAL HISTORY Constitutional: Reports no history of multiple sclerosis or brain tumors. HENT: Reports occasional headaches. CURRENT MEDICATIONS Gabapentin and tegretol. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Musculoskeletal: Denies any history of sclerosis. Neurological: Reports headaches. VITALS Tylenol is recommended for pain control. PHYSICAL EXAM Eyes: No weakness noted in either eye. MSK: Examination of the right face: No pain with smile. NECK: There is a little bit of dullness on the left side of his face. The right side feels sharp. CV: Normal. RESULTS X-rays of the bilateral upper extremities are unremarkable. ASSESSMENT Right- sided bilateral trigeminal neuralgia. PLAN After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her MRI revealed a small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trig eminal nerve. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we start with the teg Gretol. We will see how that goes and if her pain continues, we can consider different surgical options. I advised her that I would like to try the teGretol first and if that does not work, she can follow up with me in 1 month.
