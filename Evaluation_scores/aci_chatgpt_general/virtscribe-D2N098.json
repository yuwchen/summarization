    "Doctor Isabella is seeing a new patient named Jose James, who is experiencing pain in his left shoulder and elbow for the past five months. The pain started after he fell while going up the stairs. Mr. James has been having difficulty lifting weights at the gym and has stopped exercising due to the pain. He and his wife continue to walk daily. He has tried icing but hasn't taken any medication for the pain. There is no numbness or tingling. During the physical examination, the doctor finds tenderness in the left shoulder and elbow and performs several tests which are positive for impingement syndrome of the left shoulder. The doctor recommends starting with physical therapy twice a week and, if that doesn't improve the pain, a cortisone injection can be considered. Mr. James agrees to try physical therapy first and will receive a referral order for therapy. He is advised to continue icing and resting, and to contact the doctor if his symptoms worsen or do not improve with therapy.",
