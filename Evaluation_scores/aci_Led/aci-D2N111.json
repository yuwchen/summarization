He states that this is the first time he has ever done something like this. The patient reports that he heard a pop when he landed on the right knee. He has been taking Tylenol for pain. He denies any relief from the pain. Mr. Scott does not work out regularly and only exercises for fun. He notes that he is trying to watch what he eats and what macros he is eating. He is not consistent with his regular exercise regimen and admits to measuring his blood pressure 4 to 5 times a week. His blood sugar is also slightly lower than usual, but he does not think this is related to his exercise regimen. Regarding his hypertension, he states that most days he remembers to take his medication, lisinopril 20 mg. He does note that his blood pressures are slightly elevated on some days but he is not comfortable with 100/80 mmHg. regarding his diabetes, he thinks his blood glucose levels are slightly better. He checks his blood sugar most days, but notes that they are usually between 80 to 90. His diet is similar to that of a keto diet.

I recommended meloxicam 15 mg daily to treat pain and swell, as well as physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury. If he is still having pain at this time, we can consider further imaging imaging, but this is a common injury that tends to heal on its own. - Additional Testing: We will order an echo for further evaluation. - Specialist Referrals: We reviewed the patient's right knee x-ray, which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality. - medical Treatment: Meloxicam15 mg daily.

He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes.\n\nApproximately 1 week ago, the patient sustained an injury to his right knee while at a trampoline park. He explains that he was jumping on a trampoline when he heard a snap, followed by instant pain in the lateral aspect of his knee. This is not a common activity for him, and he admits that he is inconsistent with exercise. As far as treatment, he has been elevating his knee and taking Tylenol without significant relief of his pain. He has not tried applying heat or ice to the area.\n\nIn terms of his hypertension, the patient admits that he did not purchase a blood pressure cuff as previously recommended. While he does not monitor his blood pressures at home, he has been compliant with lisinopril 20 mg.\n\nHis diabetes appears to be stable based on home monitoring, although he is only checking his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week. He does not follow any specific diet plan, but he does try to make healthier choices such as limiting his carbohydrate intake.
