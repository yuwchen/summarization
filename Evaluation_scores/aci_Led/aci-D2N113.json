HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Jackie Collins is a pleasant 53-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of hepatitis C. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his symptoms began when his blood work revealed the presence of hepatitis c. He denies any history of iv drug use or hepatitis C in the past. He did use to drink a lot of alcohol and drink about a beer a day and slightly more on the weekends. He is no longer a smoker but he was up to 1 to 2 cigarettes a day prior to 15 years ago. Today, he is down to 0.5 to 1.5 cigarettes per day. Of note, the patient reports he is tired at the end of the day after working but otherwise he has been good. He states he tends to be a workaholic.

Gastrointestinal: Bowel sounds are present. Abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly. Hematology/Lymphatic/Immunology: No enlarged lymph nodes. VITALS All vital signs are within normal limits. PHYSICAL EXAM SKIN: In no apparent distress. No swelling. MSK: Examination of the abdomen: No hematochezia. No enlarged bowel sounds. RESULTS The results of her recent blood work were reviewed today.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN The patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his current symptoms. His blood work today revealed a positive hepatitis C antibody test. His initial labs are consistent with hepatitis C but additional blood work will be needed to confirm the diagnosis. I advised the patient that additional work up should also reveal the hepatitis C rna and genotype. I also advised him that I would like to determine the severity of his liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver. I will order a special ultrasound for further evaluation. All questions were answered. INSTRUCTIONS The patient will follow up in 3 weeks.", "Hepatitis C.
