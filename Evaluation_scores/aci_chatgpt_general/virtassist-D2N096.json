    "Summary:\nThe patient, Mrs. Anderson, presents with left shoulder pain that has lasted for a week. She took Tylenol for a few days, but it didn't help. The pain started after she was in a gymnastics class and may have occurred due to a certain move. The doctor examines her and determines that there is no broken bone or fracture but suspects a joint injury. The doctor suggests using ibuprofen three times a day for a week and recommends using ice or a heat pad if the pain persists. The patient mentions a past surgery on her left arm, but the doctor doesn't believe it is related to the current pain. The doctor advises resting the left arm and not carrying heavy weights, using the right hand instead. If the pain continues after three weeks, the patient should return for further evaluation. The doctor may consider another x-ray at that time. Medications and procedures are ordered as discussed. The patient hopes that ibuprofen will help and asks if she can call the doctor or make another appointment if the pain worsens. The doctor suggests trying Advil or Aleve and thanks the patient.",
