    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 35-year-old male who presents with neck pain following a rear-end car accident a week ago. He reports a sudden onset of pain when his neck and head jerked forward. He rates the pain as 7/10 and says it worsens with neck movement. He has tried ibuprofen with minimal relief. He denies any swelling, bruising, hearing or visual problems, or previous neck injuries. He did not seek medical attention at the time of the accident due to cost concerns.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n The patient has positive pain to palpation of the soft tissues of the neck, especially on the posterior aspect. He also has positive pain with flexion, extension, rotation, and lateral bending of the neck. There is no tenderness or deformity of the cervical spine. The cranial nerves are intact and the rest of the neurological exam is normal.  \nRESULTS\n The cervical spine x-ray shows no fracture or bony abnormality.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The patient is diagnosed with neck strain, likely due to whiplash injury. He is prescribed anti-inflammatory medication (motrin 600 mg every 6-8 hours) and muscle relaxant (flexeril 10 mg every 12 hours as needed) for pain management. He is advised to avoid further neck strain and to use a soft collar if needed. He is ordered an MRI of the cervical spine to rule out any soft tissue damage or concussion. He is referred to either physical rehab or a chiropractor for further evaluation and treatment once the MRI results are available. He is instructed to follow up in a week or sooner if his symptoms worsen or change. He has no questions and understands the plan.",
