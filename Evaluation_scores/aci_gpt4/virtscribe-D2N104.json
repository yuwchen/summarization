    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Judy Gomez is a 59-year-old female with a history of psoriatic arthritis who presents for a follow-up visit. She has been on methotrexate and prednisone for her joint pain and inflammation. She reports improvement in her symptoms since the last visit, except for occasional flare-ups in her feet that require an extra dose of prednisone. She also received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and experienced worsening pain after the first dose, but was advised to continue with the methotrexate. She has no other complaints or concerns.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n Vital signs are normal. Musculoskeletal exam reveals mild tenderness and swelling in the metatarsophalangeal joints of both feet, and no other signs of active arthritis. Skin exam shows psoriatic plaques on the elbows and knees, and nail pitting and ridging. She has multiple bruises on her arms and legs that she attributes to prednisone.  \nRESULTS\n No labs or imaging were done today.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n Psoriatic arthritis, stable on methotrexate, prednisone to be discontinued. She will have blood work done to monitor her liver function and blood counts. She will follow up in three months or sooner if needed. She was educated on the potential side effects of methotrexate and the importance of adherence. She was reassured that the bruises are likely from prednisone and should resolve once the medication is stopped. She was satisfied with the visit and had no further questions.",
