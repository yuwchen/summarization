    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nShortness of breath.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nLawrence Walker is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 1 diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux, who presents with complaints of shortness of breath.\n\nThe patient states he has had some shortness of breath and mild leg swelling which he thinks has to do with eating some salty foods at some house parties recently. His shortness of breath is primarily with exertion such as walking up the stairs. This has been going on for about 10 days now. He woke from sleep once with shortness of breath about a week ago. He also notes discomfort lying flat in bed and musculoskeletal stiffness in the morning. He states that it takes him a little while to get up.\n\nRegarding his type 1 diabetes, he is using his insulin pump. He has been consistently monitoring his blood sugars during the working week, but notes that he checks less on the weekends, due to being busy. He is trying to avoid sugar but admits to an affinity for chocolate bars.\n\nRegarding his depression, he states that it has been a crazy year and a half. He has tried some natural solutions. In the summer, he did daily outdoor stretching, which was great; but now that the weather has changed, he needs to find some alternatives. He is not ready to try any medications. He denies suicidal and homicidal ideation.\n\nRegarding his GERD, he is taking his omeprazole. He has made some lifestyle modifications like cutting back on his red bull intake and other caffeine. Reducing his alcohol intake has been tough during the holiday season, but he is getting better about this.\n\nThe patient denies chest pain, fever, chills, cough, and abdominal pain.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills.\u00a0 Endorses fatigue.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain. Endorses dyspnea on exertion.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Denies coughor wheezing. Endorses shortness of breath..\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Endorses lower extremity edema.\n\u2022 Psychiatric: Endorses depression.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\n\u2022 Neck: No carotid bruits appreciable. No jugular venous distention.\n\u2022 Respiratory: Rales are heard bilaterally at lung bases.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: 1+ pitting bilateral lower extremity edema.\n\nRESULTS\n\nChest x-ray did not show any evidence of airspace disease.\n\nLabs were all within normal limits, including the WBC.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLawrence Walker is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 1 diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux, who presents with complaints of shortness of breath.\n\nPLAN\n\nAcute heart failure exacerbation.\n\u2022 Medical Reasoning: The patient is retaining fluid. He has noticed increased fluid retention following dietary indiscretion. He has experienced dyspnea on exertion for the past 10 days.\n\u2022 Medical Treatment: Initiate Lasix 40 mg a day.\n\u2022 Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor and log his daily weights.
