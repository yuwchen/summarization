    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of asthma since childhood. She presents with complaints of frequent coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath that occur every month or every other month for the past six months. She reports that her symptoms are triggered by viral infections, exposure to cat dander, and sometimes by smoking in bars. She has had multiple visits to the urgent care and the emergency department for asthma exacerbations, and has been treated with antibiotics, steroids, and albuterol inhalers. She uses her albuterol inhaler almost daily and sometimes at night. She has no history of hospitalization for asthma since she was eight years old. She denies smoking, vaping, or marijuana use. She enjoys hiking but has to be careful with her breathing. She has no history of seasonal allergies.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n  Vitals BP 128/82, RR 16, SpO2 99% on RA HEENT Neck supple, trachea midline, no lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruits CV RRR, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Resp Diminished breath sounds bilaterally with occasional expiratory wheezes Ext Strong bilateral pulses, no clubbing, brisk capillary refill  \nRESULTS\n  Pulmonary function test FEV1/FVC 72%, FEV1 65% predicted, consistent with moderate intermittent asthma  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n  Asthma The patient has moderate intermittent asthma that is poorly controlled with frequent exacerbations and daily symptoms. She is started on flovent 110 mcg one puff twice per day as a maintenance therapy, and advised to continue using ventolin two puffs every four to six hours as needed for acute relief. She is given an asthma action plan to monitor her symptoms and adjust her medications accordingly. She is counseled on avoiding triggers, such as cat dander and smoking, and on proper inhaler technique. She is scheduled for a follow-up visit in one month or sooner if her symptoms worsen.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nAsthma.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of asthma.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient denies the use of any type of cigarette or tobacco product, as well as marijuana.

She enjoys being outside and hiking.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nDenies seasonal allergies.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports using an albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nRespiratory: Reports coughing and wheezing.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure: 128/82 mm Hg.\nRespiratory rate: 16\nO2 saturation: 99% on room air.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeck\n- General Examination: Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. Trachea is midline. No carotid bruit.\n\nRespiratory\n- Auscultation of Lungs: Diminished lung sounds throughout with the occasional slight expiratory wheeze, bilaterally.\nCardiovascular\n- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No ectopic beats. No rubs, murmurs, or gallops.\n\nMusculoskeletal\n- Examination: Strong bilateral radial pulses. No clubbing. Brisk capillary refill.\n\nHematology/Lymphatic/Immunology\n- Palpation: No enlarged lymph nodes.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPulmonary function test obtained today is reviewed and findings are consistent with asthma.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Moderate intermittent asthma.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms and results of her PFT are consistent with moderate intermittent asthma.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of consistency with her daily inhaler as this will help prevent daily symptoms and the need to use the albuterol inhaler as frequently. My hope is that she has less acute exacerbations as she continues to use her inhaled steroid.\n- Medical Treatment: Prescribed provided for Flovent 110 mcg 1 puff twice per day. She can continue using her Ventolin inhaler 2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours as needed. I have recommended using her albuterol inhaler 1 to 2 puffs and then monitor her breathing prior to taking an additional 1 to 2 puffs. I am also going to put together an asthma action plan for her so we know what to do based on her symptoms.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up in 1 month for reevaluation or sooner for worsening symptoms.\n",
