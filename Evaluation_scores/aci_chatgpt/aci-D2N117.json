    " \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n  Mr. Jackson is a 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes type two and mild intermittent asthma. He is here today with right elbow pain. According to the patient, he has been playing a lot of tennis recently, which has been killing him for the last three weeks.   \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n  Mr. Jackson's exam was for the most part normal with a few exceptions. On the musculoskeletal exam, he has moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow with moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow. With resisted extension of the right wrist, he also had mild pain.  \nRESULTS\n  The patient's right elbow x-ray shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality. Hemoglobin A1c level and CBC blood tests were also ordered.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n  Mr. Jackson is diagnosed with acute lateral epicondylitis of his right elbow, also known as tennis elbow. The patient is advised to rest his right arm as much as he can, stop tennis for the next four to six weeks, and avoid repetitive stress in that right arm. The doctor recommends icing the right elbow for 20 minutes at least three times per day and also provides him with a brace. Ultram is prescribed to the patient for the elbow pain. The doctor also increases Mr. Jackson's metformin to 1000 milligrams twice per day to control diabetes type two. The patient's mild acute intermittent asthma remains under control, so the doctor prescribes a refill of albuterol. The patient is to be seen back in four weeks to re-evaluate his elbow.",
