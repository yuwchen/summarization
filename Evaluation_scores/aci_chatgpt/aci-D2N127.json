    " \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n  Brandon has been experiencing neck pain due to a car crash. He has been in multiple car crashes in the past and has had surgery for the third one. His recent accident occurred in February 2021, and he has been experiencing neck pain ever since. The pain is sharp and debilitating, with a score of 12 on a scale of 1 to 10. Brandon has been prescribed medication from a pain clinic, including fentanyl, which he has not taken in weeks. He is experiencing stiffness, headaches, dizziness, and numbness in his left arm and right leg. He is unable to move his neck from side to side or forward without severe pain.   \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n  The doctor performed a physical examination by palpating Brandon's neck and asking him to move it. Pain was present on palpation of the bony process and the muscle. Brandon had moderate range of movement to swivel his neck from side to side. However, bending his neck forward and backward caused severe pain. The doctor did not observe any swelling, lacerations or bruising.   \nRESULTS\n  An x-ray did not show any fracture, but the doctor is ordering an MRI for further evaluation. The diagnosis for Brandon is a neck sprain that may also be caused by multiple factors.   \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n  The doctor wants to treat Brandon's neck pain conservatively with exercise, robaxin medication, and icing his bruising areas. If the medication doesn't work, the doctor may refer him to pain medicine and physical therapy. The doctor also suggests that local injections may be an option to relieve his neck pain. Brandon will be given off for work and wait for the MRI result before taking additional action.",
