    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 45-year-old female who presents with anxiety about her recent diagnosis of hepatitis C. She reports that she was never told in the past that she has hepatitis C and she has been feeling fine. She admits to a history of IV drug use and alcohol abuse in the past, but she has been clean for over 15 years and has reduced her alcohol intake to one beer a day. She also smokes one to two cigarettes a day. She denies any other medical conditions, except for feeling tired at the end of the day after work. She has a family history of hypertension, diabetes, and depression.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n On general appearance, the patient appears in no distress and no jaundice. Heart exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur. Lung exam is clear with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Abdomen exam shows normal bowel sounds, soft abdomen, and no hepatosplenomegaly. Musculoskeletal exam is normal with no gait disturbance and no edema.  \nRESULTS\n The patient's HCV antibody test was positive and her liver panel showed an elevated AST at 39, but normal ALT, albumin, and total bilirubin.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The patient has hepatitis C with mild liver enzyme elevation. The next steps are to confirm the diagnosis with HCV RNA and genotype tests, and to assess the liver fibrosis with a special ultrasound. The patient will be counseled on the treatment options and the risk of transmission to her family members. The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up visit in three weeks.",
