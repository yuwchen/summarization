    "\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n Bobby presents with right shoulder pain he has had for a few weeks. His pain is located on the outside of his shoulder, especially when he raises his arm. Bobby's pain occurs when he moves his arm and when he is lying on his side. He has had shoulder issues before, but it does not seem to be located in the rotator cuff. He has been taking Advil and icing as much as possible to relieve his pain.   \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n The doctor reviews Bobby's vitals and they appear to be normal. He has limited active and passive range of motion in his right shoulder and tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus. Bobby's left shoulder does not present any symptoms. Bobby has a good hand grip and his capillary refill is less than three seconds. An X-ray of his right shoulder shows no fracture.   \nRESULTS\n There is no fracture present in Bobby's right shoulder.   \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n Bobby's symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. The doctor plans to order an MRI to ensure there is no underlying issue. Bobby will be referred to physical therapy for six to eight weeks. During this time, he will continue to take Tylenol. If his symptoms persist, the doctor will consider a steroid injection. As for Bobby's sore feet, he may try soaking them in Epsom salts.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight shoulder pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBobby Flores is a 56-year-old male, right-hand-dominant, male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right shoulder pain.\n\nThe onset of his pain began a few weeks ago, when he was performing different projects in his backyard. He states that he was sore all over the next couple of days. He locates his pain to the lateral aspect of his right shoulder. His pain is aggravated with movement. The patient denies any restriction with his arm. He also reports pain at night when he sleeps on his right side. The patient denies any numbness in his arm or hands. He has been taking Advil and icing his shoulder, which provides some relief. The patient reports a history of right shoulder pain when he was younger while playing baseball.\n\nThe patient also has complaints of bilateral foot and ankle pain. He attributes this pain to the yard work he has been doing. For treatment, he has iced and elevated them, which provided some relief.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Positive for right shoulder pain.\nNeurological: Negative for numbness in hands.\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature: 97.8 degrees F.\nHeart Rate: 62 BPM.\nRespirations:16.\nBlood pressure: 116/84 mm Hg.\nOxygen saturation: 99 percent on room air.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: >Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds.\nNEURO: Normal sensation. Neurovascularly intact on the right. Sensation to touch is intact on the right shoulder.\nMSK: Examination of the right shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness at the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or AC joints. Good hand grip.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right shoulder were taken. These reveal no fracture or dislocation. No abnormalities noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Right shoulder rotator cuff tendinopathy.\n2. Bilateral foot pain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right shoulder to evaluate for a possible rotator cuff tear. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy for 6 to 8 weeks. He can continue taking Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend a cortisone injection.\n\nIn regards to his bilateral feet pain, I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I am recommending the patient soak his feet in an Epsom salt soak as well as elevate as needed.\n",
