    "The patient, Lawrence, is a 62-year-old male with type I diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux. He presents with complaints of shortness of breath and swelling in his legs. He experiences shortness of breath when walking up stairs and has noticed the swelling for about 10 days. He also mentions feeling lethargic and uncomfortable when waking up in the morning. The patient mentions a past occurrence of waking up short of breath at night. The doctor asks about the patient's diabetes and blood sugar levels, as well as his efforts to manage his depression and reflux. Lawrence reports that he has been monitoring his blood sugar levels and has not seen any spikes. He mentions trying natural solutions for his depression but is open to suggestions. The doctor notes that Lawrence has been making lifestyle modifications for his reflux and asks about his alcohol intake and any issues with depression. The patient denies any intention to harm himself or others. The doctor proceeds with a physical exam and finds crackles and 1+ pitting edema in the patient's lungs and lower extremities. The doctor orders a chest x-ray and reviews the results, finding no evidence of airspace disease. The labs also come back normal, ruling out infection. The doctor diagnoses Lawrence with an acute heart failure exacerbation and prescribes Lasix and daily weight monitoring. For his diabetes, the doctor orders a hemoglobin A1c test and recommends follow-up with an endocrinologist and an eye exam. Lawrence is referred to psychiatry for talk therapy to address his depression, and he is advised to continue taking omeprazole for his reflux. Lawrence is instructed to contact the doctor if he experiences any worsening of his breathing.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nShortness of breath.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nLawrence Walker is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 1 diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux, who presents with complaints of shortness of breath.\n\nThe patient states he has had some shortness of breath and mild leg swelling which he thinks has to do with eating some salty foods at some house parties recently. His shortness of breath is primarily with exertion such as walking up the stairs. This has been going on for about 10 days now. He woke from sleep once with shortness of breath about a week ago. He also notes discomfort lying flat in bed and musculoskeletal stiffness in the morning. He states that it takes him a little while to get up.\n\nRegarding his type 1 diabetes, he is using his insulin pump. He has been consistently monitoring his blood sugars during the working week, but notes that he checks less on the weekends, due to being busy. He is trying to avoid sugar but admits to an affinity for chocolate bars.\n\nRegarding his depression, he states that it has been a crazy year and a half. He has tried some natural solutions. In the summer, he did daily outdoor stretching, which was great; but now that the weather has changed, he needs to find some alternatives. He is not ready to try any medications. He denies suicidal and homicidal ideation.\n\nRegarding his GERD, he is taking his omeprazole. He has made some lifestyle modifications like cutting back on his red bull intake and other caffeine. Reducing his alcohol intake has been tough during the holiday season, but he is getting better about this.\n\nThe patient denies chest pain, fever, chills, cough, and abdominal pain.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Constitutional: Denies fevers, chills.\u00a0 Endorses fatigue.\n\u2022 Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
