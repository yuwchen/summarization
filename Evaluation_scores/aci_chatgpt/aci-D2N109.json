    "\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n Ms. Stephanie Morales, a 36-year-old female with a history of diabetes and hypertension, presented today with a complaint of left ankle pain after slipping on snow and ice two days ago. She reports that she has been taking ibuprofen, using ice and elevation, and experiencing mild relief. She reports no pain above the ankle, bleeding, or difficulties in standing or walking.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n The patient's heart, lung, and abdominal exam showed normal findings. The patient has tenderness over the lateral malleolus and the fifth metatarsal, and some redness and swelling were observed on the left ankle exam. A systolic ejection murmur was heard. Sensation and pulse were found to be normal.  \nRESULTS\n An x-ray was ordered to rule out the possibility of a fracture in the left ankle. A hemoglobin A1C was ordered to check the patient's diabetes status. Baseline labs were ordered to monitor the patient's general health status.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n Ms. Morales appears to have an ankle sprain. She was given an air splint and crutches and was asked to avoid weightbearing. Naprosyn (500 milligrams twice daily) was prescribed for pain control. The results of the x-ray and the baseline labs will be reviewed to develop further management plans for the patient. The patient was advised to keep the eye appointment for diabetes checkup, continue with metformin, and refill the norvasc prescription. The patient was given instructions to call the clinic if there are any issues with her health.",
