He has no other complaints.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n Vital signs are normal. HEENT exam is normal. Cardiovascular exam reveals a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, unchanged from prior exam. Respiratory exam is normal. Abdominal exam is normal. Musculoskeletal exam reveals moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow, moderate pain with passive range of motion, and mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist. There is no joint effusion or deformity. Neurological exam is normal.  \nRESULTS\n Right elbow x-ray shows no acute fracture, malalignment, or joint effusion. Hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and Chem-12 are pending.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n   - Acute lateral epicondylitis of the right elbow (tennis elbow) due to overuse. Plan Rest, ice, brace, Ultram 50 mg daily, follow-up in four weeks, consider additional imaging or physical therapy if needed. - Diabetes type 2 with suboptimal glycemic control. Plan Increase Metformin to 1000 mg twice daily, check blood sugar twice daily, follow-up in two weeks, adjust medication as needed. - Mild intermittent asthma, well controlled.
