    "The patient, Michelle, injured her knee while skiing and had to be taken down the hill by the ski patrol. She is experiencing pain on the outside of her knee and feels like it won't hold her weight. She is unable to fully bend or straighten her knee, and experiences pain when trying to straighten it completely. She does not have any numbness or tingling in her toes and can feel them fine. Michelle leads an active lifestyle, chasing after her two four-year-old children. Her husband helps out, but he is often away for work. The doctor performs a physical exam and finds edema and an effusion over the right knee, as well as decreased flexion and extension. A positive Lachman sign is also observed. The doctor suspects a ruptured ACL and orders a knee MRI to confirm. Michelle is currently taking ibuprofen for pain, which helps somewhat. The doctor prescribes a knee brace for additional support. The next steps will be determined based on the MRI results. Michelle does not have any specific exercise preferences, but hopes to eventually get back to running.",

    "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight knee injury\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMichelle King is a pleasant 44-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. Her injury was sustained while skiing in Vermont last weekend after she caught her ski when coming off of the lift and fell. She reports a pop in her knee at the time of injury and has been experiencing pain since that time. Due to her fall she was unable to weight bear and had to be taken down by the ski patrol. She locates her pain to the lateral aspect of her knee and also describes the feeling of instability as well as buckling. At this time she is experiencing difficulty with knee flexion; however, she states this was not a problem immediately after the injury. Full knee extension is also quite painful for her. The patient denies any numbness or tingling in her toes. She is currently utilizing crutches for ambulation which were provided to her by the ski patrol. In terms of pain control, she is taking ibuprofen which is providing some relief.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports she is otherwise healthy and denies a history of high blood pressure or diabetes.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports she is very active with skiing and taking care of her 4-year-old twins. She mentions that she would like to get back into running at some point. She states that her husband is home with her, but he also works a job where he has gone quite a bit.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports she is taking ibuprofen.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and limited range of motion.\nNeurological: Denies numbness or tingling in toes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGAIT: The patient is ambulating with crutches.\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur.\nRESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear to auscultation.\nMSK: Examination of the right knee: Edema and effusion noted. Pain with palpation of the lateral knee. Decreased flexion and extension. Positive Lachman's. Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse. No ankle edema.\n\nRESULTS\n\n4 views of the right knee were taken today. These reveal no bony abnormalities.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight knee pain, possible ACL tear.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible ACL tear. In the meantime, I have advised her to continue taking ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg every 8 hours as needed for pain. She will also be placed into a brace for increased knee support.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.",
