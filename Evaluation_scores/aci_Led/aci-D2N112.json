HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Matthew Murphy is a pleasant 20-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of lower back pain. The onset of his pain began approximately 1 month ago, however it has progressively worsened. He notes that he has been sitting in the waiting area for approximately 30 minutes today, which has resulted in his symptoms worsening. The patient rates his pain as 8 out of 10, stating that his pain goes into the hip side of the leg and down into the left leg when he walks. He adds that his foot drags when he tries to walk. Mr. Murphy reports that his back has been bothering him for a long time. He reports that he can not tie his shoes, and standing makes his pain worse. He also notes that standing seems to worsen his pain. He explains that he fell off of a roof approximately 30 years ago and sustained injuries. He states that he could not play football at that time so he tried to take care of himself. The patients denies any numbness or tingling in his lower extremities, as well as any weakness in his legs. He describes his pain today as electrical tooth ache that radiates down his left leg. He rates his current pain as 6/10, but notes that when it gets really bad, it is 13/10. The only thing that seems to make his pain better is laying down. He has been using a cane, which does not provide him with relief. The Patient denies any chief complaint. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Musculoskeletal: Reports back pain and leg pain. Neurological: Denies numbness and tingles in lower extremity. VITALS All vital signs are within the normal limits. PHYSICAL EXAM MSK: Examination of the back: No bony abnormalities noted. No redness or no bruising. Pain to palpation at the L4 vertebrae. Pain with flexion and extension of back. Strength of the legs is 4/5 in the left and 5/5 on the right. RESULTS An MRI of the lower back was obtained and reviewed today. It demonstrates a disk herniation at the level of L4-5 vertebraes. It is associated with nerve root impingement. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 1. Acute disk hernia at L4 - 5 with nerveroot impingements. - Medical Reasoning: The patient presents today with symptoms similar to those of acute disk hernirations. - Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the nature of his diagnosis and that he should be referred to see his primary care physician for further evaluation. I explained to him that his MRI revealed a 4-5 disk seen on the opposite side of his MRI was not significant and that I am purposely trying to be difficult with the patient because he does not answer all of the questions. - Additional Testing: We will perform an epidural steroid injection today. We will place anti-inflammatory medication right at the area of inflammation, and once that is in place, I will refer him back to physical therapy to strengthen the area. Patient Agreements: the patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan. INSTRUCTIONS The patient will follow up with me in 1 month.", "Back pain.

He rates his pain level as a 6 to 8 out of 10, however it can get to a 13 out of 10 at its worst. He states that he did not take any medication before his appointment so it did not affect his pain during our visit.
