    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  The patient is a 35-year-old female who has a history of chronic headaches since her teenage years, usually associated with her menstrual cycles and stress. She reports that her headaches have worsened in frequency and severity in the past few months, and are now mostly on the right side and behind her eye, with a pulsing sensation. She also complains of ringing in her ears and intermittent blurred vision on the right side. She denies any numbness, tingling, or weakness. She has been trying to exercise more to lose weight, but her headaches limit her activity. She has not had a recent MRI of her brain, and was referred by her PCP for further evaluation.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n  Vitals BP 120/80, HR 72, RR 16, T 36.5, O2 98% on room air HEENT PERRLA, EOMI, funduscopic exam reveals bilateral papilledema, no other abnormalities Cardiovascular S1, S2, normal sinus rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Respiratory Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi Abdominal Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no masses, no organomegaly Neurological Cranial nerves I-XII intact, normal corneal reflex, normal gait, no focal deficits Musculoskeletal Normal range of motion, no joint swelling or tenderness, no deformities  \nRESULTS\n  Pending MRI of brain and spinal tap Referred to neuro-ophthalmology for eye exam  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n  The patient's symptoms are suggestive of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), a condition of increased intracranial pressure without an identifiable cause. The differential diagnosis includes other causes of increased intracranial pressure, such as brain tumor, venous sinus thrombosis, or pseudotumor cerebri. The patient will undergo an MRI of brain to rule out any structural lesions, and a spinal tap to measure the opening pressure and relieve any excess fluid. She will also be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist to assess the extent of her papilledema and visual field defects. If the diagnosis of IIH is confirmed, she will be started on medication to lower the intracranial pressure, such as acetazolamide or topiramate, and advised to continue with exercise and weight loss as part of the treatment. She will be followed up closely for any changes in her symptoms or vision, and referred to neurosurgery if there is no improvement or worsening. She is counseled on the potential complications of IIH, such as permanent vision loss, and the importance of compliance with the treatment plan. She is given the opportunity to ask questions and express any concerns. She is scheduled for a follow-up visit in two weeks.",

The patient was referred from her primary care physician. The patient states that she was seen by Dr. White a few years ago and was going to obtain an MRI; however, Dr. White wanted her to see me first and urgently.\n\nThe onset of her headaches began when she was a teenager. Initially, her headaches appeared during menses, however she now experiences them more frequently and with more severity. Her pain is aggravated by physical activities. The patient states that she has been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight, however she is unable to exercise for prolonged periods of time secondary to the headaches. The patient locates her pain to the right side of her head and behind her eye. She describes her pain as a pulsing sensation. She also reports intermittent ringing in her ears for the last few months. Additionally, she reports intermittent blurred vision on the lateral aspect of her vision. She denies any numbness or tingling in her hands, feet, or face.\n\nThe patient enjoys running and wears either New Balance or Asics shoes.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nNeurological: Reports headaches.

We will contact her to schedule this after approved by insurance. Once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion, I will also perform a spinal tap to evaluate the pressure in the brain. I have also advised her to be seen by a neuro ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam. Questions were invited and answered today.
