HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Larry Mitchell is a pleasant 80-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of chronic lumbar back pain. The patient was referred by his primary care physician. He began experiencing back pain after he was moving furniture one weekend ago. He describes his pain as sharp, stabbing pain in his back that goes down to his right leg sometimes all the way to his toe. He also feels that he can not get comfortable when he sits down. Mr. Mitchell reports some numbness and tingling in his right lower extremity, but denies any loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area. He denies any weakness. He has tried physical therapy before but it is only temporary. When his pain gets really bad, they have had to prescribe strong pain medications for him, which he interprets as temporary. They have also discussed surgery with him in the past, but he would like to avoid surgery. He tries to be as active as he can as much as possible but it has been difficult with his back pain and he has gained some weight over the past years. He used to like to play golf but this has definitely set him back. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Musculoskeletal: No overlying erythema. Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat: No redness or ecchymosis. Tenderness at L4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbal paravertebral tenderness. Neurological: Decreased sensation to the right lateral thigh at l4. Light touch at the right medial thigh atL4. PHYSICAL EXAM MSK: Examination of the bilateral ankles: symmetrical patellar and achilles reflexes. RESULTS The MRI results are consistent with an L4 L5 disk herniated with radiculiculopathy. ASSESSMENT Lumbar L4 disk herniation with nerve impingement. PLAN After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his MRI results were consistent with l4 l 5 disk hernia. I recommend a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid. We will monitor his response to the injection and the patient\u2019s intervals can be different as well. This procedure is relatively quick and common and he should be out of the office within an hour. If that works for him today, we will get him scheduled to start his first injection.", "Back pain.
