    "Summary:\n\nThe patient, Mr. Jackson, is a 45-year-old male with a history of type two diabetes and mild intermittent asthma. He presents to the doctor with right elbow pain, which he attributes to playing tennis. The pain is located on the outside of the elbow and is described as sharp, stabbing, and very painful when in use. The doctor asks about any trauma or worsening factors, as well as other symptoms, such as pain radiating down the arm or shoulder, but the patient reports none. He has tried over-the-counter pain medications and ice, but they provide only temporary relief.\n\nThe doctor discusses the patient's medical history, including his diabetes, asthma, allergies, and past surgical procedures. The patient's heart exam reveals a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur, which has not changed since the last exam. The musculoskeletal exam reveals tenderness and pain in the right elbow, both with passive range of motion and resisted extension of the wrist. The x-ray shows no fractures or other abnormalities. The patient denies having a fever.\n\nThe doctor's assessment is acute lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, due to overuse. The doctor recommends rest, avoiding repetitive stress, and stopping tennis for four to six weeks. The patient is advised to ice the elbow and is given a brace. A prescription for Ultram (tramadol) is given for pain relief. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in four weeks.\n\nRegarding the patient's diabetes, the doctor notes that blood sugar levels have been elevated, likely due to increased candy consumption during Easter. The doctor recommends increasing the dosage of metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day and asks the patient to monitor blood sugar levels twice daily for the next two weeks. Hemoglobin A1c and CBC blood tests are ordered. The doctor also orders a Chem-12 blood test. \n\nThe patient's mild intermittent asthma remains under control with the current medication regimen, but a refill for the albuterol prescription is given.\n\nOverall, the patient's conditions are addressed with specific recommendations and medication adjustments. The doctor plans to reevaluate the elbow in four weeks and make further decisions based on the patient's progress.",
