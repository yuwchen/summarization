    "\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n Julia Jones is a 25-year-old female presenting for evaluation of symptomatic macromastia for breast reduction. Julia has had back pain and neck pain since high school and has been seeing a chiropractor for the past few years. Julia would also like to address limited activity, and pain associated with exercise. Julia has not had children but may be planning to in the future. She has noticed that her breasts are asymmetrical with severe ptosis bilaterally.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n Inspection reveals asymmetrical breasts with severe ptosis bilaterally. No nipple retraction or discharge bilaterally. No breast tenderness, masses, or axillary lymphadenopathy is palpable.  \nRESULTS\n Minimum required resection based on a bsa of 2.65, with the schnur scale is 1,792 grams, which should be attainable. The breast measurements reveal one breast is a little lower than the other, and there is potential for using a nipple graft.   \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n Julia Jones is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Surgery involves the removal of breast tissue from the breast, nipple position elevation, lifting, and contouring. The surgery will take approximately three hours, and she will need to spend one night at the hospital. After surgery, clear plastic tape will be placed over her incision to prevent scars. Patients with lighter skin may have red scars at first, but over time they will mature in line. Julia will have activity restrictions for about six weeks, and the drains will stay in for about a week. Once Julia's new insurance information is confirmed, the office will work with her to schedule a surgery date. In the meantime, photos were taken to document Julia's symptoms and submitted to the insurance company for approval.",
