    "Possible clinical note  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a 34-year-old female who injured her right knee while skiing in Vermont last weekend. She reports that she caught her ski when coming off the lift and fell, feeling a pop in her knee. She was unable to bear weight and had to be taken down by the ski patrol. She has had persistent pain, swelling, and instability of the right knee since then. She denies any numbness, tingling, or vascular compromise in the right lower extremity. She is otherwise healthy and active, with no chronic medical conditions. She has two four-year-old twins and a husband who works intermittently.  \nPHYSICAL EXAM\n The patient is alert and oriented, with normal vital signs. Her heart sounds are regular and without murmurs. Her lungs are clear to auscultation. Her right knee examination reveals edema and an effusion, pain to palpation of the lateral knee, decreased flexion and extension, a positive Lachman sign, and intact distal pulses. There is no leg edema or ankle deformity.  \nRESULTS\n The patient had a right knee x-ray that showed no bony abnormality.  \nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n The patient has a high suspicion for a right ACL tear, based on the mechanism of injury, the physical exam findings, and the patient's symptoms. She will undergo a right knee MRI to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out any other associated injuries, such as meniscal or collateral ligament tears. She will be fitted with a knee brace to provide stability and support. She will continue with ibuprofen for pain relief. She will be counseled on the possible surgical options and graft choices for ACL reconstruction, depending on the MRI results and her activity level and goals. She will follow up with the orthopedic surgeon after the MRI. She understands the risks and benefits of the plan and has no questions at this time.",
